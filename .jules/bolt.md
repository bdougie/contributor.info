## 2024-05-23 - Activity Feed Performance Bottleneck
**Learning:** The `ActivityItem` component was performing O(N*M) calculations (filtering all PRs and comments) for every activity item rendered. Since the activity feed renders many items for the same user, this resulted in massive redundant computation (15x-20x slowdown for 50 items).
**Action:** Implemented a shared `WeakMap` cache for contributor activity counts keyed by the `pullRequests` array. This transforms the complexity from O(Activities * PRs) to O(PRs) (amortized constant time lookup per activity). Future list items should avoid inline heavy aggregations over the parent data context.
