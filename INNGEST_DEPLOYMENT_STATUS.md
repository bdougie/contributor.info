# 🎉 Inngest Deployment to Supabase - COMPLETED

## ✅ Deployment Status

The Inngest function has been **successfully deployed** to Supabase Edge Functions!

**Deployment Details:**
- **Function Name:** `inngest-prod`
- **Endpoint:** `https://egcxzonpmmcirmgqdrla.supabase.co/functions/v1/inngest-prod`
- **Script Size:** 147.1kB
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed and running

## 🔐 Required: Set Environment Variables

The function is deployed but needs environment variables to be configured. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/set-supabase-env.sh
```
This script will prompt you for each required value.

### Option 2: Set via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/egcxzonpmmcirmgqdrla/settings/functions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `INNGEST_PRODUCTION_EVENT_KEY` - Get from Inngest Dashboard
   - `INNGEST_PRODUCTION_SIGNING_KEY` - Get from Inngest Dashboard
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Your GitHub API token
   - `INNGEST_APP_ID` - Set to: `contributor-info`

### Where to Find Your Keys:

#### Inngest Keys:
1. Go to https://app.inngest.com/
2. Select your app (contributor-info)
3. Go to Settings → Keys
4. Copy the **Production Event Key** and **Production Signing Key**

#### GitHub Token:
- Use your existing GitHub token from Netlify environment variables
- Or create a new one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## 🧪 Test the Deployment

After setting environment variables:
```bash
# Test the endpoint
./scripts/test-supabase-inngest.sh

# View live logs
supabase functions logs inngest-prod --project-ref egcxzonpmmcirmgqdrla --tail
```

## 📦 What's Included

### Migrated Functions:
- ✅ `captureRepositorySyncGraphQL` - Fully implemented
- ✅ `classifySingleRepository` - Fully implemented
- ✅ `updatePrActivity` - Simple implementation
- ✅ `testFunction` - For testing connectivity
- 🔲 Other functions - Stub implementations (can be migrated as needed)

### Infrastructure:
- ✅ Netlify routing updated (`/api/inngest` → Supabase)
- ✅ Old Netlify function disabled
- ✅ CORS headers configured
- ✅ 150s timeout (vs 26s on Netlify)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables** (if not done already)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/set-supabase-env.sh
   ```

2. **Register with Inngest**
   Once environment variables are set, Inngest should auto-discover the endpoint at:
   `https://contributor.info/api/inngest`

3. **Monitor Function**
   ```bash
   # View logs
   supabase functions logs inngest-prod --project-ref egcxzonpmmcirmgqdrla --tail

   # Check Inngest Dashboard
   # https://app.inngest.com/
   ```

4. **Test a Job**
   Trigger a test event from Inngest Dashboard or via the API.

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### If you see 401 Unauthorized:
- Environment variables are not set
- Run: `./scripts/set-supabase-env.sh`

### If you see 500 errors:
- Check logs: `supabase functions logs inngest-prod --project-ref egcxzonpmmcirmgqdrla`
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly

### To redeploy the function:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-supabase-inngest.sh
```
