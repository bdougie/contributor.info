---

### 7. capture-repository-issues
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Event**: `capture/repository.issues`
**Purpose**: Discover and sync repository issues

**Key Features**:
- Fetches issues from last N days (default 30)
- Filters out PRs (GitHub API returns both)
- Only processes issues with comments
- Stores issue metadata and statistics

**Configuration**:
- Default time range: 30 days
- Max 100 issues per sync
- Filters: state=all, has comments

---

### 8. capture-repository-sync (REST API)
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Event**: `capture/repository.sync`
**Purpose**: REST API alternative to GraphQL sync

**Key Features**:
- Uses REST API for PR fetching
- Fallback option if GraphQL fails
- Similar functionality to GraphQL sync
- Less efficient but more reliable for some repos

**When to Use**:
- Large repositories with complex PR structures
- When GraphQL rate limits are exhausted
- Debugging or comparison purposes

---

### 9. update-pr-activity
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Event**: `update/pr.activity`
**Purpose**: Update comments and reviews for existing PRs

**Key Features**:
- Finds PRs that need activity updates
- Prioritizes open PRs
- Checks recently updated PRs
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

**Logic**:
- Always check open PRs
- Check closed PRs updated in last N days
- Skip if synced within last 6 hours

---

### 10. discover-new-repository

**Purpose**: Add new repositories to tracking system

**Key Features**:
- Race condition protection (checks for existing repos)
- Fetches repository metadata from GitHub
- Creates repository record in database
- Returns existing repo ID if already tracked

**Data Captured**:
- Repository metadata (name, description, language)
- Statistics (stars, forks, issues)
- Settings (is_fork, is_archived, is_private)
- Timestamps (created, updated, pushed)

---

### 11. classify-repository-size
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Event**: `classify/repository.size`
**Purpose**: Batch classify multiple repositories by size

**Key Features**:
- Processes multiple repositories in one job
- Star-based classification (small < 100, large > 1000)
- Updates size_class field in repositories table
- Error handling per repository (continues on failures)

**Classification Logic**:
- Small: < 100 stars
- Medium: 100-1000 stars
- Large: > 1000 stars

---

### 12. classify-single-repository
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Event**: `classify/repository.single`
**Purpose**: Classify a single repository on-demand

**Key Features**:
- Same classification logic as batch function
- Triggered individually for immediate classification
- Used after repository discovery
- Updates repository record immediately

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. GraphQL Preferred Over REST
- GraphQL functions are more efficient (fewer API calls)
- Single query can fetch PR + reviews + comments
- Better rate limit usage
- REST functions kept as fallback

### 2. Contributor Management
- All contributors are created automatically during data capture
- Upsert pattern prevents duplicates
- github_id is unique constraint
- Bot detection based on username pattern

### 3. Error Handling
- NonRetriableError for permanent failures (404, missing data)
- Retries for temporary failures (rate limits, network issues)
- Graceful degradation (skip items with errors, continue processing)

### 4. Rate Limit Protection
- Configurable cooldown periods between syncs
- Throttling at function level (Inngest config)
- Concurrency limits by repository
- Rate limit tracking in GraphQL client

### 5. Data Integrity
- github_id is unique identifier for all GitHub entities
- Upsert pattern ensures idempotency
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Timestamps tracked for all records

---

## Database Tables Updated

### Primary Tables
- `repositories` - Repository metadata and statistics
- `pull_requests` - PR data and statistics
- `contributors` - GitHub users and bots
- `reviews` - PR reviews
- `comments` - PR comments and issue comments
- `issues` - GitHub issues

### Key Fields
- `github_id` - Unique GitHub identifier (string)
- `repository_id` - UUID reference to repositories
- `author_id` - UUID reference to contributors
- `comment_type` - 'issue_comment' or 'review_comment'
- `state` - PR/review state (open, merged, closed, approved, etc.)

---

## API Rate Limits

### GitHub REST API
- 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Functions implement throttling and concurrency limits
- Cooldown periods between syncs

### GitHub GraphQL API
- 5,000 points/hour
- More efficient than REST (1 query vs multiple)
- Point cost varies by query complexity
- Rate limit tracking built-in

---

## Testing the Functions

### 1. Test Repository Sync (GraphQL)
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.supabase.co/functions/v1/inngest-prod \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "capture/repository.sync.graphql",
    "data": {
      "repositoryId": "uuid-here",
      "days": 30,
      "reason": "manual"
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Test PR Details Capture
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.supabase.co/functions/v1/inngest-prod \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "capture/pr.details.graphql",
    "data": {
      "repositoryId": "uuid-here",
      "prNumber": "123",
      "prId": "uuid-here"
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Test Repository Discovery

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Supabase Logs
- View real-time logs in Supabase Dashboard
- Functions > inngest-prod > Logs
- Filter by severity (info, warn, error)

### Inngest Dashboard
- View function runs and status
- Monitor rate limits and throttling
- Retry failed jobs
- View event history

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check recent PR syncs
SELECT * FROM repositories
ORDER BY last_updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check PR capture status
SELECT r.owner, r.name, COUNT(p.id) as pr_count
FROM repositories r
LEFT JOIN pull_requests p ON p.repository_id = r.id
GROUP BY r.id, r.owner, r.name;

-- Check contributor creation
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_contributors,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN is_bot THEN 1 END) as bot_count
FROM contributors;
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limits**: GitHub API has strict rate limits. Functions implement cooldowns but heavy usage may still hit limits.

2. **Large Repositories**: Repositories with thousands of PRs are limited to 100-150 PRs per sync to prevent timeouts.

3. **Comment Depth**: Review comment threads are not fully traversed (no recursive reply fetching).

4. **Historical Data**: Functions sync recent data (last 30 days by default). Full historical sync requires separate tooling.

5. **Pagination**: Some functions don't paginate fully to prevent long execution times.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Webhook Integration**: Replace polling with GitHub webhooks for real-time updates
2. **Incremental Sync**: Only fetch data newer than last sync timestamp
3. **Smarter Classification**: Use ML or more metrics for repository sizing
4. **Comment Threading**: Full thread reconstruction for review comments
5. **Parallel Processing**: Use Inngest fan-out pattern for large repositories
6. **Metrics Collection**: Track function performance and success rates
7. **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle permanently failed jobs

---

## Implementation Notes

- All functions use TypeScript with proper type safety (no `any` types in critical paths)
- Console logging uses format strings (%s) to prevent security issues
- Error messages are descriptive but don't leak sensitive data
- All database operations use parameterized queries (Supabase handles this)
- GitHub IDs stored as strings (not integers) to prevent overflow
- Timestamps use ISO 8601 format for consistency
- UUIDs used for all internal database references
