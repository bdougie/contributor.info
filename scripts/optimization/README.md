# Optimization Scripts

Performance optimization tools for GitHub Actions and Inngest processing systems.

## Overview

These scripts optimize the hybrid processing system to achieve maximum efficiency, cost savings, and performance across both Inngest and GitHub Actions.

## Scripts

### `github-actions-optimizer.js`

**Purpose**: Optimize GitHub Actions workflow performance and resource usage.

**When to use**:
- Before major releases
- When GitHub Actions jobs are running slowly
- During cost optimization initiatives
- Weekly performance reviews

**What it does**:
- Analyzes GitHub Actions job performance
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Recommends workflow improvements
- Optimizes resource allocation and concurrency

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/optimization/github-actions-optimizer.js
```

**Output**:
- Job performance analysis
- Resource usage recommendations
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization suggestions

### `inngest-optimizer.js`

**Purpose**: Optimize Inngest function performance and reduce processing costs.

**When to use**:
- When Inngest jobs are failing or timing out
- During cost optimization reviews
- Before scaling to new repositories
- Performance troubleshooting

**What it does**:
- Analyzes Inngest function execution times
- Identifies rate limiting issues
- Optimizes concurrency settings
- Reduces processing costs

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/optimization/inngest-optimizer.js
```

**Output**:
- Function performance metrics
- Rate limit analysis
- Concurrency recommendations
- Cost optimization suggestions

## Optimization Targets

### GitHub Actions Optimization
- **Job Duration**: Target < 10 minutes per job
- **Setup Time**: Minimize to < 2 minutes
- **Resource Usage**: Optimal CPU/memory allocation
- **Concurrency**: Balance speed vs. cost

### Inngest Optimization
- **Function Execution**: Target < 30 seconds per function
- **Rate Limits**: Stay within GitHub API limits
- **Retry Logic**: Minimize failed retries
- **Concurrency**: Optimize for throughput

### Hybrid System Optimization
- **Job Routing**: Right-size jobs to optimal processor
- **Cost Efficiency**: Maximize savings while maintaining performance
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure no gaps between processors
- **User Experience**: Maintain immediate feedback for interactive operations

## Performance Workflow

1. **Run baseline analysis**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/optimization/github-actions-optimizer.js
   node scripts/optimization/inngest-optimizer.js
   ```

2. **Identify bottlenecks** from the analysis output

3. **Apply recommended optimizations**

4. **Re-run analysis** to validate improvements

5. **Monitor ongoing performance** with regular checks

## Integration

These optimizers work with:
- **Monitoring system**: Performance trend analysis
- **Rollout system**: Optimization during gradual rollouts
- **Cost analyzer**: Validate cost savings from optimizations
- **Validation system**: Ensure optimizations don't break functionality

## Expected Results

After optimization, expect:
- **60-85% cost reduction** from hybrid approach
- **Faster processing times** for both historical and recent data
- **Improved reliability** with fewer timeouts and failures
- **Better resource utilization** across both processing systems

## Safety Notes

- Optimization scripts are **analysis-only** by default
- Review recommendations before applying changes
- Test optimizations in development first
- Monitor performance after applying changes
- Keep backup configurations for rollback

Use these tools to ensure the hybrid processing system operates at peak efficiency while delivering maximum cost savings.
