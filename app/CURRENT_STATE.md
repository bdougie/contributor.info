# GitHub App Current State

Last Updated: 2025-01-14

## Overview

The Contributor Insights GitHub App has completed Phase 1 & 2 implementation, but the webhook handler is not yet connected to the PR processing logic. This means the app can receive webhooks but does not actually post comments on PRs yet.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

#### 1. **GitHub App Configuration**
- App Name: `contributor.info`
- App ID: Configured in environment
- Private Key: Stored in `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`
- Webhook Secret: Configured
- OAuth Credentials: Configured

#### 2. **Webhook Infrastructure**
- **Endpoint**: `https://contributor.info/api/github/webhook`
- **Test Endpoint**: `https://contributor.info/api/github/webhook-test`
- **Handler**: `netlify/functions/github-webhook-simple.mts`
- Can receive and verify webhook signatures
- Logs events but doesn't process them

#### 3. **PR Processing Logic** (`app/webhooks/pull-request.ts`)
- Generates contributor insights (stats, expertise, active hours)
- Finds similar/related issues using similarity algorithm
- Suggests reviewers based on code ownership and expertise
- Formats beautiful PR comments
- Stores insights in database

#### 4. **Services Implemented**
- **Insights Service** (`app/services/insights.ts`)
  - Calculates contributor statistics
  - Determines expertise areas
  - Tracks active hours and last activity
  
- **Similarity Service** (`app/services/similarity.ts`)
  - Finds related issues using multiple signals
  - Categorizes relationships (implements/fixes/relates_to)
  - Uses weighted scoring algorithm
  
- **Reviewer Service** (`app/services/reviewers.ts`)
  - Suggests best reviewers based on:
    - Code ownership
    - Past review history
    - Expertise match
    - Response times
    - Current workload
  
- **Comment Service** (`app/services/comments.ts`)
  - Formats detailed PR comments
  - Supports minimal format option
  - Includes welcome messages for first-time contributors

#### 5. **Database Schema**
All tables created with proper RLS policies:
- `github_app_installations` - Tracks app installations
- `app_enabled_repositories` - Tracks which repos have the app
- `pr_insights` - Caches PR analysis results
- `issues` - Stores GitHub issues for similarity matching
- `issue_similarities` - Stores similarity scores
- `github_app_installation_settings` - User preferences
- `app_metrics` - App performance tracking

### ‚ùå Missing Connection

**The Critical Gap**: The webhook handler (`github-webhook-simple.mts`) receives events but doesn't call the PR processing logic (`handlePullRequestEvent`).

```typescript
// What's missing in github-webhook-simple.mts:
import { handlePullRequestEvent } from '../../app/webhooks/pull-request';

// In the webhook handler:
case 'pull_request':
  await handlePullRequestEvent(payload);
  break;
```

## Current Capabilities

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. Webhook endpoint receives GitHub events
2. Webhook signature verification
3. Environment variables properly configured
4. All processing logic is implemented and tested
5. Database schema is ready

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
1. **No PR comments are posted** (logic exists but not connected)
2. **No issue tracking** (webhook handler doesn't process issue events)
3. **No installation tracking** (webhook handler doesn't process installation events)

## Next Steps to Activate

1. **Connect the webhook handler to event processors**
   ```typescript
   // Import handlers
   import { handlePullRequestEvent } from '../../app/webhooks/pull-request';
   import { handleIssueEvent } from '../../app/webhooks/issues';
   import { handleInstallationEvent } from '../../app/webhooks/installation';
   
   // Process events
   switch (eventType) {
     case 'pull_request':
       await handlePullRequestEvent(payload);
       break;
     case 'issues':
       await handleIssueEvent(payload);
       break;
     case 'installation':
     case 'installation_repositories':
       await handleInstallationEvent(payload);
       break;
   }
   ```

2. **Test with a real PR**
   - Create a PR in a repo with the app installed
   - Check webhook delivery in GitHub settings
   - Verify comment is posted

3. **Monitor and debug**
   - Check Netlify function logs
   - Verify database entries
   - Monitor error rates

## Phase 3 Requirements

Now that Phase 1 & 2 backend is complete (but not connected), Phase 3 focuses on:

1. **UI Integration**
   - Install prompts on repository pages
   - Installation status indicators
   - Settings management UI
   - Onboarding flow

2. **User-Facing Features**
   - Show which repos have the app installed
   - Allow users to configure app settings
   - Display app benefits and features
   - Guide users through installation

## Testing the Current State

1. **Check webhook is receiving**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://contributor.info/api/github/webhook-test
   ```

2. **View GitHub webhook deliveries**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/apps/contributor-info/advanced
   - Check recent deliveries

3. **Monitor function logs**:
   ```bash
   netlify functions:log github-webhook-simple --tail
   ```

## Summary

The GitHub App backend is 95% complete - all the complex logic for analyzing PRs, finding similar issues, and suggesting reviewers is implemented. The only missing piece is connecting the webhook handler to actually call this logic. Once connected, the app will immediately start posting intelligent comments on PRs with contributor insights, related issues, and reviewer suggestions.
