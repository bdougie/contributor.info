The **Distribution Charts** feature provides visual insights into how contributions are distributed across programming languages, file types, and contributor quadrants in your repository. This powerful visualization helps you understand the technical diversity and contribution patterns within your project.

## Overview

Distribution charts show the breakdown of pull request activity across different programming languages and contribution types. The visualization uses both treemap and scatter plot formats to help you identify areas of high activity, technical expertise concentrations, and potential gaps in your project.

## Key Visualizations

### Language Distribution Treemap
- **Size-based representation**: Languages are displayed as rectangles sized by contribution volume
- **Color-coded categories**: Different colors represent various programming languages and file types
- **Interactive exploration**: Click on language blocks to filter and focus on specific technologies
- **Contribution metrics**: Shows both PR count and lines of code changed per language

### Quadrant Analysis
The distribution view includes a unique quadrant-based analysis that categorizes contributions:

- **ðŸŸ¢ High Impact, High Effort**: Major features and significant refactoring work
- **ðŸŸ¡ High Impact, Low Effort**: Bug fixes and targeted improvements  
- **ðŸ”µ Low Impact, High Effort**: Documentation, tests, and infrastructure work
- **âšª Low Impact, Low Effort**: Minor tweaks and routine maintenance

## Understanding the Data

### Language Insights
Each language block shows detailed metrics including pull request count, contributor count, and average contribution size. This helps identify which technologies are most actively maintained and where expertise is concentrated.

### Contribution Patterns
The quadrant view reveals team workflow patterns and helps identify contributors who focus on different types of work. Some contributors may specialize in high-impact features while others focus on maintenance and documentation.

## Filtering and Time Ranges

### Language Filtering
Click any language in the legend or treemap to filter the entire view to that specific technology. This is particularly useful for large polyglot repositories where you want to focus on specific technical areas.

### Time Range Analysis
Use the time range selector (30, 60, or 90 days) to analyze how language distribution changes over time:
- **30 days**: Recent development focus
- **60 days**: Medium-term technical trends  
- **90 days**: Long-term language evolution patterns

## Actionable Insights

### For Technical Leads
Use distribution charts to identify skill gaps, plan technical training, and understand where different contributors have expertise. The quadrant analysis helps with task assignment and workflow optimization.

### For Project Maintainers
Monitor language distribution to ensure balanced maintenance across all technologies in your stack. Identify languages that may need more contributor attention or documentation.

### For Contributors
Understand where your contributions fit within the project's technical landscape and discover areas where you can expand your impact or expertise.

## Integration with Other Features

Distribution charts work seamlessly with other contributor.info features. Filter by contributor quadrant and then explore those contributors' profiles, or combine language insights with lottery factor analysis to understand technical risk distribution.

The distribution charts provide essential visibility into the technical health and diversity of your repository, helping teams make informed decisions about resource allocation and technical strategy.
