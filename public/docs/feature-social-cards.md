## Visual Design Elements

All social cards maintain consistent contributor.info branding while allowing repository-specific customization through:

- **Color schemes**: Reflecting repository language distribution
- **Layout adaptations**: Optimized for different data types and metrics
- **Typography hierarchy**: Clear information organization and readability

### Mobile and Platform Optimization
Cards are designed to display clearly across different social media platforms and screen sizes, with optimized dimensions for Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other sharing contexts.

## Automatic Generation

### Real-Time Updates
Social cards regenerate automatically when repository data changes, ensuring shared content always reflects current project status without manual intervention.

### Multiple Format Support
Cards are available in multiple formats optimized for different use cases:

- **Web formats**: PNG and WebP for fast loading and broad compatibility
- **High resolution**: Suitable for printing and high-DPI displays
- **Optimized compression**: Balanced quality and file size for efficient sharing

### Performance Optimization
The card generation system uses efficient caching and CDN distribution to ensure fast loading times regardless of when or where cards are accessed.

## Usage Scenarios

## Best Practices

### Sharing Etiquette
Always ensure you have appropriate permissions before sharing social cards for repositories you don't maintain, and respect project privacy preferences.

### Content Freshness
Social cards automatically update, but consider the timing of sharing to ensure metrics reflect meaningful activity periods rather than temporary fluctuations.

The Social Cards feature transforms contributor analytics into shareable content that helps promote projects, recognize contributors, and communicate project health to wider audiences.
