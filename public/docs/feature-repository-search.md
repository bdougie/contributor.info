The **Repository Search & Tracking** feature enables you to discover, analyze, and monitor GitHub repositories through an intuitive search interface. This is your entry point to exploring any public repository's contributor patterns and project health metrics.

## Overview

The search system allows you to analyze any public GitHub repository by entering either the repository URL or the owner/repo format. Once searched, repositories can be tracked for ongoing monitoring and comparison across different time periods.

## Search Methods

### URL Input
Enter complete GitHub repository URLs:
```
https://github.com/facebook/react
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
```

### Owner/Repository Format  
Use the shorthand format for quick searches:
```
facebook/react
microsoft/vscode
etcd-io/etcd
```

### Search Validation
The system automatically validates repository existence and accessibility, providing clear error messages for private repositories, non-existent repos, or invalid formats.

## Featured Repositories

### Example Repository Gallery
The home page includes curated examples of popular open source projects that demonstrate different contributor patterns and project types:

- **Large Enterprise Projects**: Examples like React, VSCode showing complex contributor ecosystems
- **Community-Driven Projects**: Projects with diverse, distributed contributor bases
- **Specialized Tools**: Focused projects with concentrated expertise areas
- **Emerging Projects**: Newer repositories showing growth patterns

### Quick Analysis Access
Click any featured repository to immediately jump to its analysis without manual search input, perfect for exploring different project types and patterns.

## Repository Insights Navigation

### Multi-Tab Analysis
Once a repository is loaded, navigate between different analysis views:

- **Contributions**: Main activity overview with PR metrics and contributor activity
- **Health**: Lottery factor analysis and project sustainability metrics  
- **Distribution**: Language and contribution pattern analysis
- **Feed**: Real-time activity stream and project pulse

### Persistent Context
Repository context persists across tabs, maintaining your current time range selection and filter preferences as you explore different aspects of the project.

## Time Range Analysis

### Flexible Time Windows
Analyze repository activity across different time periods:

- **30 Days**: Recent activity and current contributor patterns
- **60 Days**: Medium-term trends and seasonal variations
- **90 Days**: Long-term evolution and strategic patterns

### Comparative Analysis
Switch between time ranges to understand how contributor patterns, activity levels, and project health evolve over time.

## Auto-Tracking Capabilities  

### Intelligent Repository Detection
The system can automatically track repositories that you frequently analyze, building a personalized dashboard of projects you monitor regularly.

### Sync Integration
For authenticated users, the system offers enhanced tracking with real-time updates and personalized insights based on your interaction patterns.

## Search Performance and Caching

### Optimized Data Loading
Repository data is cached intelligently to provide fast subsequent analysis while ensuring data freshness for active projects.

### Progressive Enhancement
Initial searches load core data quickly, with additional insights and detailed analytics loading progressively to maintain responsive user experience.

## Best Practices

### Repository Selection
- **Public repositories only**: Private repositories require appropriate access credentials
- **Active projects**: Repositories with recent activity provide more meaningful insights
- **Sufficient history**: Projects with several months of activity show clearer patterns

### Analysis Approach
Start with the main Contributions view to get an overview, then explore Health metrics for sustainability insights, and use Distribution analysis to understand technical patterns.

### Time Range Strategy
Begin with 30-day analysis for current state, expand to 90 days for trend analysis, and compare different periods to understand project evolution.

The Repository Search & Tracking system makes it easy to discover insights about any public GitHub repository, transforming raw GitHub data into meaningful contributor intelligence.
