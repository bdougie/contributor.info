The **Time Range Analysis** feature enables flexible temporal exploration of repository activity, allowing you to analyze contributor patterns, project health, and development trends across different time periods. This temporal flexibility provides context-aware insights for various planning and analysis needs.

## Overview

Time range analysis transforms static metrics into dynamic insights by enabling comparison and analysis across 30, 60, and 90-day windows. This temporal dimension reveals patterns, trends, and seasonal variations that are essential for understanding project evolution and making informed decisions.

## Available Time Ranges

### 30-Day Analysis (Recent Focus)

### Trend Indicators
Visual indicators show whether metrics are trending upward, downward, or remaining stable across different time periods.

## Time-Sensitive Insights

### Contributor Lifecycle Analysis
Different time ranges reveal different aspects of contributor engagement:

- **30 days**: Current active contributors and immediate engagement
- **60 days**: Contributor consistency and medium-term commitment patterns  
- **90 days**: Long-term contributor retention and development trajectories

### Project Phase Recognition
Time range analysis helps identify project phases:

- **Development sprints**: High activity periods focused on feature development
- **Maintenance phases**: Lower activity periods focusing on bug fixes and stability
- **Release cycles**: Activity patterns around version releases and milestones
- **Community growth**: Periods of expanding contributor base and engagement

## Strategic Applications

### Planning and Forecasting
