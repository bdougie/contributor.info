## Instructions
I need to do some clean up in parallel tasks. 
1. First all docs need to be in the /docs folder. 
2. Doing the same for scripts/ and scripts/README.md but also ensure that any move scripts are linked properly to where they are being called.

## Instructions
- All md files should be lowercased.md
- README.md is capitalized and place each subfolder to be a TOC with short descriptions of folder contents

## Context
- Documentation: 
- docs
- scripts/
