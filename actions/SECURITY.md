# GitHub Actions Security Documentation

## Continue Review Action Security

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

âœ… **Implemented Security Measures:**
- Using `actions/create-github-app-token@v2` with SHA pinning
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour expiration)
- Least-privilege permissions defined
- SHA-pinned all external actions
- PEM key stored in GitHub Secrets (never in code)

### Security Considerations

#### Token Management
- Generated tokens expire in 1 hour
- Tokens inherit permissions from the GitHub App installation
- Job-level permissions restrict what the workflow can access:
  - `contents: read` - Read code for review
  - `pull_requests: write` - Post review comments
  - `issues: write` - Update issue comments

#### Action Pinning
All actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs:
```yaml
actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1
actions/create-github-app-token@5d869da34e18e7287c1daad50e0b8ea0f506ce69 # v2.0.0
```

### Future Security Enhancements (Phase 2)

- [ ] Implement environment protection rules
- [ ] Add manual approval for sensitive operations
- [ ] Set up audit logging for token usage
- [ ] Quarterly PEM key rotation schedule

### Security Checklist

Before modifying workflows:
- [ ] Pin all new actions to SHA
- [ ] Verify action source and maintainer
- [ ] Review requested permissions
- [ ] Test in non-production first
- [ ] Document security rationale

### Incident Response

If a security issue is suspected:
1. Immediately rotate the APP_PRIVATE_KEY
2. Review audit logs for unauthorized usage
3. Update all SHA pins to latest verified versions
4. Document incident in security log
