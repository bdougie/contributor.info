# Example Documentation Review Outputs

## Example 1: All Checks Pass (With Context)

```markdown
## ðŸ“š Documentation Review

<!-- docs-review-action -->

âœ… **All documentation checks passed!**

### What we validated:

**docs/features/new-feature.md:**
- âœ… Document is properly structured with 3 code block(s), bullet points, numbered lists
  - Line 45: Code example found
  - Line 78: Code example found
  - Line 112: Code example found
- âœ… Clear writing with 5 active voice instances, no TODO markers
  - Line 12: Active voice - "Install the dependencies using npm install..."
  - Line 34: Active voice - "Configure your environment variables in the .env file..."
  - Line 56: Active voice - "Run the application with npm start..."
- âœ… User-focused documentation with 3 key element(s)
  - Step-by-step instructions found
  - Code examples included
  - Prerequisites documented

### Rules applied:

- **Copywriting**: Active voice, no marketing fluff, clear error messages
- **Scannable Format**: Visual breaks, code examples, bullet points
- **Documentation Purpose**: User docs show "how to use", dev docs explain "how it works"

_For full guidelines, see `.continue/rules/`_
```

## Example 2: With Issues (Detailed Feedback)

```markdown
## ðŸ“š Documentation Review

<!-- docs-review-action -->

Found 5 suggestion(s) for documentation improvements:

- ðŸ”´ 2 error(s)
- ðŸŸ¡ 2 warning(s)
- ðŸ”µ 1 suggestion(s)

### Details:

**docs/setup/installation.md:**
- ðŸ”´ Line 45: Documentation contains TODO marker. Complete or remove before publishing.
- ðŸŸ¡ Line 23: Found 4 consecutive paragraphs without visual breaks. Add code examples, bullet points, tables, or images to improve scannability.
- ðŸ”µ Line 67: Sentence is too long (35 words). Break into smaller sentences for better readability.
- ðŸŸ¡ Line 89: Avoid marketing speak. Be clear and direct.
- ðŸ”µ Line 102: Replace redundant phrase with "to" for conciseness

### ðŸ“– Documentation Purpose

**User Documentation** (`/mintlify-docs`):
- Show **how to use** the product with step-by-step instructions
- Include **prerequisites** and expected **outcomes**
- Add **code examples** users can copy and run

**Developer Documentation** (`/docs`):
- Explain **how the architecture works** (system design, component relationships)
- Document **technical decisions** and rationale
- Include **file locations** and navigation hints
- Explain **infrastructure and deployment** details

For full guidelines, see `.continue/rules/`
```

## Key Improvements

### Before
The action would always output:
> âœ… All documentation checks passed! The documentation follows the copywriting and formatting guidelines.

This provided no context about:
- What files were checked
- What specific rules were applied
- Which parts of the documentation were well-written
- Line numbers of code examples or good practices

### After
The action now provides:
- **Specific line numbers** for code examples, active voice usage, etc.
- **Counts** of structural elements (code blocks, bullet points, etc.)
- **Examples** of what passed validation (e.g., "Line 45: Code example found")
- **Context** about which documentation purpose was validated (user vs. dev docs)
- **Clear breakdown** of what rules were applied

This makes the feedback actionable and demonstrates the action is actually working!
