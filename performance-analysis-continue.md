# Performance Analysis: /i/continue

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**URL**: http://localhost:5173/i/continue
**Page**: Continue Workspace Overview

## Core Web Vitals

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): 776ms ✅
- **Status**: Good (< 2.5s)
- **LCP Element**: Text content (node ID 706)
- **Breakdown**:
  - TTFB: 2ms (0.3%)
  - **Render Delay: 774ms (99.7%)** ⚠️ Main issue

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): 0.00 ✅
- Perfect score - no layout shifts

### FCP Not explicitly measured in this trace

## Performance Issues

### 1. Render Delay (774ms) - PRIMARY ISSUE
99.7% of LCP time spent in render delay. This indicates:
- Heavy JavaScript execution blocking render
- Large React component tree hydration
- Excessive client-side processing before paint

### 2. Third-Party Impact
**Supabase**: 3.8 MB transferred
- Largest third-party contributor
- Main thread impact: minimal (< 1ms)
- Issue: Large transfer size, but cached (304 responses)

**PostHog**: 36.7 kB transferred
- Main thread: 0.6ms
- Relatively small impact

**GitHub**: 840 B transferred
- Negligible impact

### 3. JavaScript Bundle Size (Development Mode)

**Total Script Requests**: 453 files
- Most are 304 (cached) in dev mode
- Heavy fragmentation in development

**Key Large Dependencies** (from network analysis):
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Large transfer
- `@tanstack/react-table` - Table functionality
- `@tanstack/react-virtual` - Virtualization
- `recharts` - Chart library
- `uplot` - Additional chart library
- `@nivo/scatterplot` - Yet another chart lib
- `lucide-react` - Icon library
- `posthog-js` - Analytics
- Multiple Radix UI components

## Optimization Recommendations

### High Priority

#### 1. Reduce Render Delay (Target: < 200ms)
- **Code Split Charts**: Lazy load chart libraries (recharts, uplot, nivo)
  ```typescript
  // Current: All charts loaded upfront
  // Recommended: Load on-demand per tab
  const Charts = lazy(() => import('./charts'));
  ```

- **Defer Non-Critical JS**:
  - PostHog analytics
  - Feature flags
  - Non-visible workspace features

#### 2. Bundle Consolidation
**Issue**: Multiple chart libraries
- `recharts` (used in workspace charts)
- `uplot` (used in some components)
- `@nivo/scatterplot` (recently upgraded)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on ONE chart library
- Remove unused libraries
- Potential savings: 100-200KB gzipped

#### 3. Optimize Initial Bundle
**Current bottlenecks**:
- 453 module requests in dev (indicates large dep tree)
- Heavy workspace features loaded on Overview tab

**Action items**:
- Route-based code splitting for workspace features
- Tab-based lazy loading (Settings, Contributors tabs)
- Defer heavy features until user interaction

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Tree Shaking Analysis
Run production build analysis:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```
Check for:
- Unused Radix UI components
- Unused Supabase features
- Dead code from workspace features

#### 5. Icon Optimization
- `lucide-react` loaded entirely
- Consider icon bundling/tree-shaking
- Only import used icons

### Low Priority

#### 6. Third-Party Optimization
- Supabase: Already cached, minimal runtime impact
- PostHog: Consider lazy loading after initial render
- Keep as-is for now

## Network Dependency Tree Issues

The insight mentioned "avoid chaining critical requests" with bounds from 192537703194 to 192538683365 (980ms of requests).

**Recommendation**:
- Analyze critical request chain in production build
- Preload key resources
- Use resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)

## Unused JavaScript Estimate

**Development Mode**: Cannot accurately measure (unbundled)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Build production bundle: `npm run build`
2. Analyze with: `npm run build:analyze`
3. Use Chrome Coverage tool on production build
4. Expected unused code: 30-40% (industry average)

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: 300-400ms LCP)
- [ ] Lazy load chart libraries per tab
- [ ] Defer PostHog initialization
- [ ] Move Settings/Contributors tabs to lazy routes

### Phase 2: Bundle Optimization (Target: < 250ms LCP)
- [ ] Consolidate to single chart library
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement icon tree-shaking

### Phase 3: Production Analysis
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer
- [ ] Use Chrome Coverage tool
- [ ] Measure real unused JavaScript
- [ ] Further code splitting based on data

## Files to Investigate

**Heavy feature loads on Overview**:
- `src/components/features/workspace/WorkspaceDashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/features/workspace/WorkspaceMetricsAndTrends.tsx`
- Chart components loaded eagerly

**Chart library usage**:
- `src/components/ui/charts/` - Multiple chart implementations
- Consider standardizing on uplot or recharts (not both)

## Metrics Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| LCP | 776ms | < 500ms | ⚠️ Needs work |
| CLS | 0.00 | < 0.1 | ✅ Perfect |
| TTFB | 2ms | < 100ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Render Delay | 774ms | < 200ms | ❌ Critical |
