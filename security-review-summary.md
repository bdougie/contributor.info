# Security Review: pull_request_target Implementation

## Updated Workflows
1. **continue-review.yml** - Continue Agent Code Review
2. **performance-monitoring.yml** - Performance Monitoring  
3. **similarity-check.yml** - Similarity Check

## Security Measures Implemented

### ✅ Least Privilege Permissions
All workflows maintain minimal required permissions:
- `contents: read` - Only read access to repository code
- `pull-requests: write` - Write access only for PR comments/reviews
- `issues: write` - Write access for issue comments (where needed)

### ✅ Explicit PR Head Checkout
When workflows need to analyze PR code, we explicitly checkout the PR head SHA:
```yaml
ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
```

This ensures:
- We're analyzing the actual PR code (not base branch)
- We're explicit about which code we're running
- Clear security boundary between trusted and untrusted code

### ✅ Conditional Logic Updates
All conditional checks updated from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target`:
- Event name checks in `if:` conditions
- Environment variable assignments
- Deployment URL generation

## Security Model

### Safe Operations (Base Context)
- Reading repository configuration
- Accessing secrets for API calls
- Posting comments/reviews to PRs

### Controlled Operations (PR Head Context)  
- Building PR code (isolated)
- Running static analysis
- Performance testing (sandboxed)

## Benefits
✅ Fork PRs now get checks run (fixes issue #576)
✅ Non-fork PRs continue working normally
✅ Maintains security boundaries with explicit checkouts
✅ No untrusted code execution in privileged context

## Verification
All three workflows will now:
1. Trigger on both forked and non-forked PRs
2. Have access to necessary secrets for their operations
3. Checkout PR head code only when analyzing/building PR changes
4. Maintain least privilege principle
