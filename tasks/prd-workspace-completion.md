## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Continue using React Query for server state, local state for UI
2. **Routing**: Use React Router with dynamic segments `/workspaces/{slug}`
3. **Data Fetching**: Extend existing hooks pattern with proper TypeScript types
4. **Components**: Follow established patterns from existing workspace components

### Database Considerations
- Workspace schema is already established
- Need to implement proper RLS policies for security
- Consider adding indexes for frequently queried data
- Plan for workspace metrics caching strategy

### Performance Requirements
- Workspace dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- Repository list supports virtual scrolling for 100+ repos
- Real-time collaboration features (future consideration)
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Security & Privacy
- RLS policies for workspace access control
- Email invitation system with token expiration
- Audit logs for workspace actions
- GDPR compliance for data export/deletion
