# Product Requirements Document: Storybook Implementation

## Project Overview

### Objective
Implement Storybook for the contributor.info React + TypeScript application to provide comprehensive component documentation, interactive development environment, and visual testing capabilities. This implementation will establish a complete component library with 100% story coverage across all UI components.

### Background
The contributor.info project currently has 50+ well-structured React components but lacks interactive documentation and isolated component development capabilities. Storybook will enhance the development workflow, improve component reusability, and provide stakeholders with a visual component library.

### Success Metrics
- **Coverage:** 100% story coverage for all components (50+ components)
- **Documentation:** Complete args/controls for all component variants
- **Visual Testing:** Automated visual regression testing setup
- **Developer Experience:** Reduced component development time by 30%
- **Stakeholder Adoption:** Design system reference used in 90% of new feature discussions

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists ✅
- **Component Architecture:** Well-organized component structure with clear separation:
  - `/src/components/ui/` - 40+ shadcn/ui primitive components
  - `/src/components/` - 20+ feature-specific components  
  - `/src/components/icons/` - Custom icon components
  - `/src/components/skeletons/` - Loading state components
- **TypeScript Support:** Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Vitest + Testing Library setup
- **Build System:** Vite configuration with proper bundling
- **Design System:** Tailwind CSS with consistent styling patterns

### What's Missing ❌
- **No Storybook Configuration:** No existing Storybook setup
- **Component Documentation:** No interactive component documentation
- **Isolated Development:** No way to develop components in isolation
- **Visual Testing:** No visual regression testing capabilities
- **Design System Documentation:** No centralized component reference

### Current Pain Points
1. **Development Workflow:** Developers must create full app contexts to test components
2. **Component Discovery:** New team members can't easily explore available components
3. **Design Handoff:** Designers can't reference interactive component states
4. **Regression Risk:** No visual testing for UI changes
5. **Documentation Drift:** Component props/usage not systematically documented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ⚡ **HIGH PRIORITY** (Days 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Decisions
- **Storybook Version:** Use Storybook 8.x for latest features and performance
- **Builder:** Leverage Vite builder for consistency with existing build system
- **Story Format:** Use Component Story Format (CSF) 3.0 for modern story structure
- **Documentation:** Combine automatic prop detection with manual MDX documentation

### File Organization
```
.storybook/
├── main.ts              # Core Storybook configuration
├── preview.ts           # Global decorators and parameters
└── theme.ts            # Custom theme configuration

src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   └── button.stories.tsx    # Co-located stories
│   └── contributor-card.tsx
│       └── contributor-card.stories.tsx
└── stories/
    ├── fixtures/        # Mock data and fixtures
    ├── decorators/      # Reusable story decorators
    └── examples/        # Complex usage examples
```

### Story Patterns
- **Naming Convention:** `ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- **Export Structure:** Default export for meta, named exports for stories
- **Controls Setup:** Comprehensive args for all public props
- **Documentation:** Include description, usage examples, and accessibility notes

### Mock Strategy
- **API Mocking:** Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for GitHub API calls
- **Data Fixtures:** Create realistic contributor, repository, and activity data
- **Context Providers:** Mock all React context dependencies in decorators

## Acceptance Criteria
