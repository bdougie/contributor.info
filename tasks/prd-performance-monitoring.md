# PRD: Production Performance Monitoring System

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring for the contributor.info application to ensure optimal database performance, API reliability, and user experience in production.

**Background**: The application currently has basic error tracking (Sentry) and analytics (PostHog), but lacks deep database performance monitoring, API rate limiting awareness, and structured logging for production debugging.

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% visibility into slow database queries (>500ms)
- Real-time alerting on connection pool exhaustion
- GitHub API rate limit utilization tracking
- <1% database connection leak rate
- Proactive performance issue detection before user impact

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Existing Infrastructure
- **Sentry**: Full error tracking, performance monitoring, session replay
- **PostHog**: User analytics and behavior tracking
- **CDN Monitoring**: Complete script with multi-region performance testing
- **Database**: Robust Supabase setup with RLS and comprehensive schema

### ❌ Current Gaps
1. **Database Performance**: No query performance tracking, connection monitoring, or index analysis
2. **Application Monitoring**: Limited structured logging for database operations and API calls
3. **Proactive Alerting**: No alerts for performance degradation or resource exhaustion
4. **API Management**: No GitHub API rate limit tracking or cache performance monitoring

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Performance Foundation (HIGH Priority)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

#### 1.1 Enable Database Extensions

- ✅ Implement connection pool metrics collection
- ✅ Add connection leak detection
- ✅ Create connection health monitoring dashboard queries

#### 1.3 Query Performance Tracking

- ✅ Set up automated performance alerts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] pg_stat_statements enabled and collecting data
- [ ] Slow queries (>500ms) automatically detected and logged
- [ ] Connection pool metrics available via Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Index usage analysis accessible for optimization

### Phase 2: Application-Level Monitoring (HIGH Priority)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

#### 2.1 Structured Database Logging
- ✅ Add database operation logging to Supabase client
- ✅ Integrate with Sentry for error correlation
- ✅ Create performance context for all database calls

#### 2.2 API Rate Limiting Awareness
- ✅ Implement GitHub API rate limit tracking
- ✅ Add rate limit headers monitoring
- ✅ Create proactive rate limit alerts

#### 2.3 Cache Performance Monitoring
- ✅ Add cache hit/miss tracking for repository data
- ✅ Monitor cache effectiveness metrics
- ✅ Alert on cache performance degradation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All database operations logged with performance context
- [ ] GitHub API rate limits tracked and alerted on
- [ ] Cache hit rates monitored and optimized
- [ ] Database errors automatically sent to Sentry with context

### Phase 3: Alerting and Dashboard Integration (MEDIUM Priority)
**Timeline**: 1 day

#### 3.1 Performance Alerting
- ✅ Configure Sentry performance alerts
- ✅ Set up database performance thresholds
- ✅ Create connection pool exhaustion alerts

#### 3.2 Monitoring Dashboard
- ✅ Create performance monitoring queries
- ✅ Document monitoring procedures
- ✅ Set up health check endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Alerts trigger on performance degradation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible to development team
- [ ] Health check endpoints available for external monitoring

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing (LOW Priority)
**Timeline**: 0.5 days

#### 4.1 Documentation
- ✅ Update monitoring documentation
- ✅ Create runbook for performance issues
- ✅ Document alerting procedures

#### 4.2 Testing and Validation
- ✅ Test monitoring under load
- ✅ Validate alert thresholds
- ✅ Confirm dashboard accuracy

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete monitoring documentation available
- [ ] Performance monitoring tested and validated
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring tools and procedures

## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Database Monitoring**: Use Supabase's built-in PostgreSQL monitoring capabilities
2. **Application Logging**: Extend existing Sentry integration for structured logging
3. **API Monitoring**: Implement rate limiting awareness in GitHub API client
4. **Alerting**: Leverage Sentry alerts for immediate notification

### Patterns to Follow
1. **Non-blocking Monitoring**: All monitoring code must not impact application performance
2. **Structured Logging**: Use consistent log formats for easy parsing and alerting
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Monitoring failures should not affect core application functionality
4. **Security First**: No sensitive data in logs or monitoring outputs

### Implementation Standards
- All monitoring code must be thoroughly tested
- Performance impact of monitoring must be <1% overhead
- Alerts must be actionable and include context for resolution
- Documentation must include troubleshooting guides

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead could affect application performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement sampling and async logging
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many false positives could reduce alert effectiveness  
  - *Mitigation*: Carefully tune alert thresholds based on baseline metrics

### Operational Risks
- **Monitoring System Failure**: Monitoring itself could fail silently
  - *Mitigation*: Implement monitoring health checks and redundant alerting
- **Data Volume**: High-frequency logging could increase costs
  - *Mitigation*: Implement log retention policies and sampling strategies

## Success Validation

### Phase 1 Success Indicators
- [ ] Database slow queries detected within 30 seconds
- [ ] Connection pool metrics updated every minute
- [ ] Index usage analysis available for all tables

### Phase 2 Success Indicators  
- [ ] 100% of database operations logged with performance context
- [ ] GitHub API rate limits tracked with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Cache hit rates monitored for all data sources

### Phase 3 Success Indicators
- [ ] Performance alerts trigger within 2 minutes of threshold breach
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] Health checks respond in <100ms

### Overall Success Criteria
- [ ] Mean time to detection (MTTD) for performance issues <5 minutes
- [ ] Zero production incidents caused by monitoring system
- [ ] 100% of performance degradation events captured and alerted
