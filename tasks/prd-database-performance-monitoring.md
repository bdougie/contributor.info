# PRD: Database Performance Monitoring Enhancement

## Project Overview

### Objective
Complete the database performance monitoring implementation by adding health check endpoints and a real-time monitoring dashboard to complement the existing comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

### Background
The project already has excellent database performance monitoring foundations including:
- pg_stat_statements extension with comprehensive monitoring views
- Advanced multi-tier caching system with performance tracking
- Sophisticated GitHub API rate limiting and monitoring
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- CLI monitoring tools for real-time analysis

### Success Metrics
- Health endpoints respond within 100ms
- Dashboard loads performance data in <2s
- Zero false positives in health checks
- Real-time monitoring accessible to development team

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Excellently Implemented
- **Database Performance Monitoring**: pg_stat_statements enabled with views for slow_queries, query_performance_summary, index_usage_stats
- **Performance Logging**: Detailed query performance tracking with historical snapshots in performance_snapshots table
- **GitHub API Monitoring**: Resource-specific rate limit tracking with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Caching System**: Multi-tier cache (Memory → LocalStorage → IndexedDB) with hit rate monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Sentry integration with performance context and automatic error capture
- **CLI Tools**: Real-time database performance analysis scripts (npm run monitor-db)

### ❌ Missing Implementation
- **Health Check Endpoints**: No standardized health endpoints for external monitoring systems
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Rich performance data exists but no web UI for visualization
- **Real-time Alerts Interface**: Alert data stored but no management interface

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Health Check Endpoints (HIGH Priority)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Deliverables
1. **Core Health Endpoint** (`/api/health`)
   - Overall system health status
   - Database connectivity check
   - Response time under 100ms
   - JSON response with status indicators

2. **Database Health Endpoint** (`/api/health/database`)
   - Connection pool status
   - Query performance metrics
   - Recent error rates
   - Cache performance indicators

3. **GitHub API Health Endpoint** (`/api/health/github`)
   - API connectivity verification
   - Rate limit status across all resources
   - Recent API error rates
   - Authentication status

#### Technical Guidelines
- Use existing monitoring infrastructure in `/src/lib/supabase-monitoring.ts`
- Leverage existing GitHub API monitoring from `/src/lib/github-api-monitoring.ts`
- Follow REST API conventions for health check responses
- Implement proper error handling and timeout protection

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/api/health` returns 200 OK with system overview in <100ms
- [ ] `/api/health/database` provides detailed DB metrics
- [ ] `/api/health/github` shows API status and rate limits
- [ ] All endpoints handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Health checks don't impact system performance
- [ ] Endpoints are accessible without authentication for monitoring systems

### Phase 2: Real-time Monitoring Dashboard (MEDIUM Priority)
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Deliverables
1. **Performance Dashboard Component**
   - React component for visualizing performance data
   - Real-time updates using existing monitoring APIs
   - Responsive design matching existing UI patterns

2. **Performance Charts**
   - Query performance trends over time
   - Cache hit rate visualization
   - GitHub API rate limit usage
   - Database connection pool status

3. **Alert Management Interface**
   - View active performance alerts
   - Alert history and resolution tracking
   - Integration with existing query_performance_alerts table

#### Technical Guidelines
- Use existing Tailwind CSS design system
- Implement using React functional components with hooks
- Leverage existing performance data from monitoring infrastructure
- Follow established component patterns in the codebase
- Use Chart.js or similar for data visualization

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard component loads performance data in <2s
- [ ] Charts update in real-time without page refresh
- [ ] Alert interface shows current and historical alerts
- [ ] Dashboard is responsive and matches existing design
- [ ] Performance data visualization is clear and actionable
- [ ] Component follows existing React patterns (no React import unless needed)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Utilization
- Leverage existing `performance_snapshots` table for historical data
- Use `query_performance_alerts` table for alert management
- Utilize monitoring views: `slow_queries`, `query_performance_summary`, `connection_stats`

### API Architecture
- Implement health endpoints as Express.js routes
- Use existing Supabase client configuration
- Follow existing error handling patterns with Sentry integration

### Frontend Integration
- Create dashboard route accessible to authenticated users
- Integrate with existing navigation structure
- Use existing state management patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Health endpoints must be lightweight and fast
- Dashboard should use efficient data fetching strategies
- Implement proper caching for dashboard data

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Building on well-established monitoring foundation
- **Proven Patterns**: Following existing codebase conventions and patterns

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Health checks must not affect system performance
- **Data Volume**: Dashboard must handle large performance datasets efficiently

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement proper connection pooling for health checks
- Use data pagination and filtering for dashboard performance
- Add comprehensive error handling and timeout protection

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Existing Supabase monitoring infrastructure
- GitHub API monitoring system
- Sentry error tracking setup
- React component architecture

### External
- No new external dependencies required
- Optional: Chart.js for advanced visualizations

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- Health endpoints operational and accessible
- External monitoring systems can query health status
- Health checks complete within performance requirements

### Phase 2 Success
- Development team has real-time visibility into system performance
- Performance issues can be identified and tracked through dashboard
- Alert management streamlines issue resolution

### Overall Success
- Complete monitoring stack from data collection to visualization
- Proactive performance issue identification and resolution
- Enhanced system reliability and maintainability
