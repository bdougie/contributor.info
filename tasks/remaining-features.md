# Remaining Features and Improvements

## Priority 1: Gradual Rollout System for Hybrid Progressive Capture

### Overview
The hybrid progressive capture system is fully implemented but currently routes ALL jobs immediately. For production safety, we need a gradual rollout mechanism.

### Requirements
From `HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_CAPTURE_PLAN.md` Step 9:

1. **Feature Flag System**
   - Environment variable control: `HYBRID_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10`
   - Database-based configuration for dynamic updates
   - Repository-level granular controls

2. **Repository Targeting Strategy**
   - Start with test repositories (whitelist approach)
   - Progress: Test repos â†’ Small repos â†’ Large repos â†’ All repos
   - Manual override capabilities for emergency rollback

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Side-by-side comparison: Hybrid vs Inngest-only
   - Real-time error rate monitoring
   - Cost tracking per rollout phase
   - User experience impact measurement

4. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Automatic rollback triggers (error rate > 5%)
   - Circuit breaker pattern for system protection
   - Manual emergency rollback via environment variable
   - Graceful degradation to Inngest-only

### Implementation Plan
