# Remaining Features and Improvements

## Priority 1: Gradual Rollout System for Hybrid Progressive Capture

### Overview
The hybrid progressive capture system is fully implemented but currently routes ALL jobs immediately. For production safety, we need a gradual rollout mechanism.

### Requirements
From `HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_CAPTURE_PLAN.md` Step 9:

1. **Feature Flag System**
   - Environment variable control: `HYBRID_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10`
   - Database-based configuration for dynamic updates
   - Repository-level granular controls

2. **Repository Targeting Strategy**
   - Start with test repositories (whitelist approach)
   - Progress: Test repos â†’ Small repos â†’ Large repos â†’ All repos
   - Manual override capabilities for emergency rollback

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Side-by-side comparison: Hybrid vs Inngest-only
   - Real-time error rate monitoring
   - Cost tracking per rollout phase
   - User experience impact measurement

4. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Automatic rollback triggers (error rate > 5%)
   - Circuit breaker pattern for system protection
   - Manual emergency rollback via environment variable
   - Graceful degradation to Inngest-only

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Rollout Infrastructure (Week 1) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create `HybridRolloutManager` class
- [x] Implement percentage-based routing logic
- [x] Add environment variable controls
- [x] Database schema for rollout configuration

#### Phase 2: Repository Targeting (Week 1) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Repository categorization (test/small/large)
- [x] Whitelist-based rollout controls
- [x] Manual override mechanisms
- [x] Rollback procedures

#### Phase 3: Monitoring and Safety (Week 2) âœ… FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETED
- [x] Real-time performance comparison dashboard âœ… (Performance monitoring dashboard implemented)
- [x] Automatic rollback triggers âœ… (Error rate based rollback at 5% threshold)
- [x] Circuit breaker implementation âœ… (Emergency stop via rollout manager)
- [x] Alert system for rollout issues âœ… (Console monitoring + auto rollback)

#### Phase 4: Gradual Deployment (Week 2-3) ðŸš€ IN PROGRESS
- [x] 10% test repositories âœ… ACTIVE (3 test repos configured)
- [ ] 25% including small production repos
- [ ] 50% of all repositories
- [ ] 100% full deployment

### Files to Create/Modify
- [x] `src/lib/progressive-capture/rollout-manager.ts`
- [x] `src/lib/progressive-capture/hybrid-queue-manager.ts` (add rollout integration)
- [x] `src/lib/progressive-capture/repository-categorization.ts`
- [x] `src/lib/progressive-capture/rollout-console.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/progressive-capture/monitoring-dashboard.ts` (add rollout metrics)
- [x] Environment variable documentation (.env.example)
- [x] Console tools for rollout management

### Success Criteria
- [x] Safe deployment with 0% production incidents (infrastructure ready)
- [x] Real-time monitoring and alerting (metrics collection implemented)
- [x] Ability to rollback within 5 minutes (manual and auto rollback)
- [ ] Performance validation at each phase
- [ ] Cost tracking and optimization

## Implementation Priority

1. **ðŸ”¥ Critical**: Gradual Rollout System (Weeks 1-3) âœ… **PHASES 1-2 COMPLETED**
2. **âš¡ Medium**: Advanced GraphQL Optimizations (Weeks 4-6)  
3. **ðŸ“Š Low**: Advanced Monitoring and Analytics (Weeks 6-8)

Each priority builds on the previous implementations and provides incremental value to the system and users.
