# PRD: Mobile Responsiveness for Distribution Charts

## Project Overview

### Objective
Fix critical mobile responsiveness issues in the distribution charts feature to ensure a seamless experience for mobile users.

### Background
Users are experiencing multiple issues when viewing distribution charts on mobile devices, including rendering problems and visibility issues that make the feature unusable on smaller screens.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero rendering issues on mobile devices
- [ ] All UI elements accessible and usable on screens 320px and wider
- [ ] Smooth scrolling without performance issues
- [ ] Touch interactions work reliably

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Donut Chart Multiple Renders**: Chart re-renders multiple times during scroll
2. **Tab Switcher Not Visible**: Distribution tab switcher is cut off or not viewable
3. **PR List Hidden**: Selected PR list is not viewable on mobile screens

### Affected Components
- Distribution chart component
- Tab switcher component
- PR list display
- Mobile viewport handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Fix donut chart re-rendering on scroll
  - Investigate scroll event listeners
  - Implement proper memoization
  - Add scroll debouncing if needed
- [ ] Make tab switcher mobile-responsive
  - Add horizontal scrolling for tabs
  - Implement mobile-friendly tab design
  - Ensure touch targets meet accessibility standards (44x44px minimum)

### Phase 2: PR List Visibility (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Fix PR list display on mobile
  - Implement responsive layout for PR cards
  - Add mobile-optimized view (possibly accordion or modal)
  - Ensure smooth transitions between states

### Phase 3: Overall Mobile Polish (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Optimize performance for mobile processors
- [ ] Add touch gestures where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure proper viewport meta tags

## Technical Guidelines

### Responsive Design Principles
- Mobile-first approach (320px minimum width)
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Implement proper breakpoints
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize re-renders using React.memo
- Debounce scroll events
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize chart rendering for mobile GPUs

### Testing Requirements
- Test on iOS Safari
- Test on Android Chrome
- Test various screen orientations
- Verify touch interactions
- Check performance on older devices

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1
- [ ] Donut chart renders only once per page load
- [ ] No re-renders during normal scrolling
- [ ] Tab switcher fully visible and functional on mobile
- [ ] All tabs accessible via scrolling or other mobile pattern

### Phase 2
- [ ] PR list visible when selected on mobile
- [ ] Content fits within mobile viewport
- [ ] Text remains readable without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Interactive elements are easily tappable

### Phase 3
- [ ] Page scores 90+ on Lighthouse mobile performance
- [ ] No layout shifts during interaction
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling on modern devices
- [ ] All features accessible on 320px width screens

## Notes
- Related to issue #431
- Consider using CSS container queries for more granular responsive control
- May need to implement mobile-specific components for optimal UX
