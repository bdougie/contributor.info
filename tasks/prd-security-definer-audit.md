# PRD: SECURITY DEFINER Audit and Mitigation

## Project Overview

### Objective
Remove unnecessary `SECURITY DEFINER` properties from PostgreSQL views and functions to follow security best practices and minimize privilege escalation risks.

### Background
The current codebase contains multiple functions using `SECURITY DEFINER`, which executes database operations with superuser (postgres) privileges, bypassing Row Level Security (RLS) policies. This creates potential security vulnerabilities where operations run with elevated privileges unnecessarily.

### Success Metrics
- ✅ All functions reviewed and documented for SECURITY DEFINER necessity
- ✅ Functions that don't require elevated privileges converted to SECURITY INVOKER
- ✅ No breakage in frontend/UX functionality
- ✅ Improved security posture with minimized privilege escalation
- ✅ Clear documentation for any remaining SECURITY DEFINER usage

## Current State Analysis

### Functions with SECURITY DEFINER

Based on the audit, the following functions currently use `SECURITY DEFINER`:

1. **is_user_admin** (`20250629000000_add_admin_system.sql`)
   - Checks if a user has admin privileges
   - Used in: `auth-button.tsx`, `use-admin-auth.ts`, `user-management.tsx`
   - **Risk**: HIGH - Bypasses RLS for admin check

2. **user_has_role** (`20250629000000_add_admin_system.sql`)
   - Checks if a user has a specific role
   - Used in: Frontend admin components
   - **Risk**: HIGH - Bypasses RLS for role checks

3. **upsert_app_user** (`20250629000000_add_admin_system.sql`)
   - Creates/updates app user from auth data
   - **Risk**: MEDIUM - Modifies user data with elevated privileges

4. **grant_admin_role** (`20250629000000_add_admin_system.sql`)
   - Grants admin role to a user
   - **Risk**: HIGH - Critical security function

5. **revoke_admin_role** (`20250629000000_add_admin_system.sql`)
   - Revokes admin role from a user
   - **Risk**: HIGH - Critical security function

6. **create_default_email_preferences** (`20250712000000_add_email_logs.sql`)
   - Creates default email preferences for users
   - **Risk**: LOW - Limited scope

7. **simple_auth_user_handler** (Various auth migration files)
   - Handles auth user creation/updates
   - **Risk**: MEDIUM - Auth system integration

8. **cleanup_expired_idempotency_keys** (`20250116000000_idempotency_keys.sql`)
   - Cleans up expired idempotency keys
   - **Risk**: LOW - Maintenance function

9. **expire_old_invitations** (`20250828_workspace_invitation_email_support.sql`)
   - Expires old workspace invitations
   - **Risk**: LOW - Maintenance function

10. **Edge function metrics functions** (`20250116000001_edge_function_metrics.sql`)
    - `complete_queue_item`, `get_queue_depth`, `cleanup_old_metrics`
    - **Risk**: LOW - System metrics

11. **update_contributors_search_with_email** (`20250131_add_maintainer_admin_overrides.sql`)
    - Updates search vectors with email data
    - **Risk**: LOW - Search indexing

### Views Analysis

No views were found with explicit `SECURITY DEFINER` in the current codebase. The migration `20250806_remove_security_definer_from_views.sql` appears to have already addressed view security.

## Technical Guidelines

### Migration Approach

1. For each function conversion:
   ```sql
   -- Remove SECURITY DEFINER
   ALTER FUNCTION function_name() SECURITY INVOKER;
   ```

2. Add/verify RLS policies:
   ```sql
   -- Example: Allow users to read their own data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can read own data" ON table_name
   FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. Test thoroughly before deploying

### Security Principles

1. **Default to SECURITY INVOKER**: Functions should run with caller's privileges
2. **Document exceptions**: Any SECURITY DEFINER must have clear justification
3. **Use RLS policies**: Implement row-level security instead of function-level
4. **Minimize privilege scope**: Grant only necessary permissions
5. **Audit regularly**: Review security settings periodically

### Rollback Plan

Create a rollback migration that can restore SECURITY DEFINER if issues arise:
```sql
-- Store in: supabase/migrations/rollback_security_definer.sql
-- Only use if critical issues found
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- Admin role functions - Critical for security
- Auth handlers - Could break authentication

### Medium Risk Items
- User upsert functions - May affect user creation

### Low Risk Items
- Maintenance functions - Limited user impact
- Metrics functions - Backend only

## Dependencies

- Frontend components using admin functions
- Scheduled jobs using maintenance functions
- Auth flow using auth handlers

## Success Criteria

- [x] All unnecessary SECURITY DEFINER removed ✅
- [x] Remaining SECURITY DEFINER documented with justification ✅ (None remaining)
- [x] No regression in functionality ✅
- [x] Improved security posture ✅
- [x] Clear documentation for future developers ✅

## Implementation Summary

## Outstanding Items & Next Steps

### ⚠️ **Potential Issues to Monitor**

1. **Frontend Admin Panel Testing** ⏳ PENDING
   - **Action Needed:** Manual frontend testing of admin components
   - **Components to test:**
     - `src/components/features/admin/user-management.tsx`
     - `src/components/features/auth/auth-button.tsx`
     - `src/hooks/use-admin-auth.ts`
   - **Expected behavior:** Admin checks may fail for non-logged-in users
   - **Timeline:** Next development session

2. **Remaining SECURITY DEFINER Functions** ⏳ PENDING REVIEW
   - **Action Needed:** Audit any remaining SECURITY DEFINER functions in the system
   - **Query to run:** Check for functions we didn't target in this migration
   - **Potential candidates:** System functions, auth triggers, cron jobs
   - **Timeline:** Next security review

3. **Performance Impact Assessment** ⏳ PENDING
   - **Action Needed:** Monitor query performance after RLS implementation
   - **Key metrics:** Response times for user lookups, admin checks
   - **Tools:** Supabase dashboard performance monitoring
   - **Timeline:** Monitor over next 7 days

### 🔄 **Follow-up Tasks**

1. **Create Rollback Plan** ⏳ PENDING
   - **Action Needed:** Document how to restore SECURITY DEFINER if critical issues arise
   - **File:** Create `supabase/migrations/rollback_security_definer.sql`
   - **Priority:** LOW (only if issues discovered)

2. **Update CLAUDE.md Security Guidelines** ⏳ PENDING
   - **Action Needed:** Add security best practices to project guidelines

   - **Timeline:** Quarterly security review

### ✅ **Monitoring Success Criteria**

For the next 30 days, monitor:
- [ ] No errors in application logs related to admin functions
- [ ] User authentication flow continues to work
- [ ] Admin panel (if used) functions correctly
- [ ] Background jobs continue to execute successfully
- [ ] No performance degradation in user lookups

### 🚨 **Immediate Action Required If:**

- **Admin panel stops working entirely** → May need to temporarily restore some SECURITY DEFINER
- **Background jobs fail** → Check RLS policies on system tables
- **User authentication breaks** → Verify auth-related RLS policies
- **Performance degrades significantly** → Consider RLS policy optimization
