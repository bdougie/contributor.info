# Storybook Interaction Tests Investigation & Fix

## Overview
The Storybook interaction tests have been consistently failing with 10 failed tests across 5 test suites. This document tracks the investigation and resolution of these issues.

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 302
- **Failed Tests**: 0 ✅ 
- **Failed Suites**: 0 ✅
- **Passing Tests**: 302 ✅

## Previously Failing Tests (Now Fixed) ✅

### 1. Dialog Component (2 failures) ✅
- ✅ `UI/Overlay/Dialog › Dialog Interaction › play-test`
- ✅ `UI/Overlay/Dialog › Dialog Keyboard Navigation › play-test`
- **Fixed**: Portal elements now use screen queries instead of canvas queries

### 2. AlertDialog Component (3 failures) ✅ 
- ✅ `UI/Overlay/AlertDialog › Alert Dialog Interaction › play-test`
- ✅ `UI/Overlay/AlertDialog › Alert Dialog Confirm Action › play-test`
- ✅ `UI/Overlay/AlertDialog › Alert Dialog Keyboard Navigation › play-test`
- **Fixed**: Portal elements handled with proper async waiting and screen queries

### 3. Select Component (2 failures) ✅
- ✅ `UI/Select › Select Interaction › play-test`
- ✅ `UI/Select › Controlled Select › play-test`
- **Fixed**: Dropdown options accessed via screen queries with proper portal handling

### 4. Button Component (2 failures) ✅
- ✅ `UI/Button › With Interaction › play-test`
- ✅ `UI/Button › Disabled Interaction › play-test`
- **Fixed**: Focus management improved with waitForFocus utility

### 5. Input Component (1 failure) ✅
- ✅ `UI/Forms/Input › Password Interaction › play-test`
- **Fixed**: Proper input type handling and new label association test added

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **Portal Rendering**: Modals/dialogs render outside storybook-root but tests can't access them
2. **Accessibility Barriers**: `aria-hidden="true"` on storybook-root blocks testing library queries
3. **Timing Issues**: Tests run before DOM is fully interactive
4. **Missing Labels**: Some form inputs lack proper accessibility labels

## Investigation Tasks

### Phase 1: Environment Analysis ✅
- ✅ Examine test-runner configuration in `.storybook/test-runner.ts`
- ✅ Check Storybook preview configuration for test environment
- ✅ Investigate portal rendering behavior in test vs. normal mode
- ✅ Review timing of play function execution vs. DOM readiness

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Fixes ✅
- ✅ Update test-runner config with portal handling utilities
- ✅ Add custom test utilities for modal/portal waiting (`src/lib/test-utils.ts`)
- ✅ Configure proper DOM query strategies for portals
- ✅ Implement focus management helpers

### Phase 3: Component Story Fixes ✅
- ✅ Fix Dialog component test interactions
- ✅ Fix AlertDialog component test interactions
- ✅ Fix Select component option selection and state verification
- ✅ Fix Button component focus and interaction tests
- ✅ Fix Input component label associations

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements ✅
- ✅ Update Storybook preview for better test environment
- ✅ Configure test-specific decorators if needed
- ✅ Ensure proper cleanup between tests
- ✅ Add error handling improvements

### Phase 5: Extended Testing (Not Started)
- [ ] Add more comprehensive accessibility tests
- [ ] Test complex interaction flows
- [ ] Add visual regression test integration
- [ ] Performance optimization for test suite

### Phase 6: Verification ✅
- ✅ Run interaction tests locally and verify all pass
- ✅ Verify build succeeds with TypeScript checks
- [ ] Test in CI environment
- [ ] Verify no regressions in visual tests
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Technical Details

### Key Debug URLs (from error log):
- Dialog: `http://127.0.0.1:6006/?path=/story/ui-overlay-dialog--dialog-interaction`
- AlertDialog: `http://127.0.0.1:6006/?path=/story/ui-overlay-alertdialog--alert-dialog-interaction`
- Select: `http://127.0.0.1:6006/?path=/story/ui-select--select-interaction`
- Button: `http://127.0.0.1:6006/?path=/story/ui-button--with-interaction`
- Input: `http://127.0.0.1:6006/?path=/story/ui-forms-input--password-interaction`

### Common Error Patterns:
```
aria-hidden="true" data-aria-hidden="true" id="storybook-root"
```
```
Unable to perform pointer interaction as the element has `pointer-events: none`
```
```
There are no accessible roles. But there might be some inaccessible roles. 
If you wish to access them, then set the `hidden` option to `true`.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Investigate/Modify:
- `.storybook/test-runner.ts` - Test configuration
- `.storybook/preview.ts` - Storybook environment setup
- Individual story files for failing components
- Test utility functions

### Testing Strategy:
1. Run tests locally with `npm run test-storybook`
2. Use Storybook dev mode to manually verify interactions
3. Check portal rendering in browser dev tools
4. Verify accessibility with screen reader testing

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All 10 failing tests pass consistently
- ✅ No new test failures introduced
- ✅ Tests run in reasonable time (< 30 seconds total)
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully
- ✅ Manual verification of component interactions works

## Notes & Observations
- The tests were working in Chromatic but failing in the test-runner
- Most failures are related to accessibility and DOM structure
- Portal components (modals, dialogs) are most problematic
- Some components may need test-specific configurations

## Implementation Summary

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Test Infrastructure** (`.storybook/test-runner.ts`):
   - Added portal handling utilities with 30s timeout
   - Configured global helpers for async portal interactions

2. **Test Utilities** (`src/lib/test-utils.ts`):
   - `waitForPortalElement` - for dialog/alertdialog portals
   - `waitForSelectOpen` - for select dropdown portals  
   - `waitForElementToDisappear` - for close animations
   - `waitForFocus` - for reliable focus testing

3. **Component Story Updates**:
   - **Dialog/AlertDialog**: Screen queries instead of canvas queries
   - **Select**: Proper portal handling for dropdown interactions
   - **Button**: Improved focus testing with wait utilities
   - **Input**: Fixed password input handling + label association tests

### Files Modified:
- `.storybook/test-runner.ts`
- `.storybook/preview.ts`
- `src/lib/test-utils.ts` (new file)
- `src/components/ui/dialog.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/alert-dialog.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/select.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/button.stories.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/input.stories.tsx`

### Phase 4 Enhancements ✅

**Storybook Preview Improvements** (`.storybook/preview.ts`):
- Added test environment enhancements with reduced animation duration
- Enhanced accessibility testing configuration for portal components
- Configured test-specific decorators with environment detection
- Added focus visibility improvements for test environments

**Test Runner Improvements** (`.storybook/test-runner.ts`):
- Added comprehensive cleanup functionality between tests
- Implemented portal element cleanup (Radix UI portals, dialogs, toasts)
- Added focus reset and CSS property cleanup
- Enhanced retry configuration for flaky tests
- Added post-render cleanup with automatic execution

**Test Utilities Enhancements** (`src/lib/test-utils.ts`):
- Added comprehensive error logging with context and debugging info
- Enhanced all utility functions with detailed error messages
- Added DOM state inspection for failed queries
- Implemented retry wrapper (`withRetry`) for flaky operations
- Improved debugging information for focus, visibility, and state issues

**Key Benefits**:
- Better test isolation and reduced flakiness
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed error information
- Automatic cleanup prevents test interference
- Improved accessibility testing for portal components
- More robust error handling with contextual information
