# Product Requirements Document: Contributor of the Month

## Introduction/Overview

The Contributor of the Month feature is designed to celebrate and recognize contributors who go above and beyond in their engagement with the repository. This feature will be prominently displayed on the activity page to highlight exceptional contributors and encourage community participation through various forms of engagement including comments, reviews, and code contributions.

## Goals

1. **Celebrate Excellence:** Recognize and celebrate contributors who demonstrate exceptional engagement and participation
2. **Encourage Engagement:** Motivate contributors to participate more actively in discussions, reviews, and code contributions
3. **Build Community:** Foster a sense of community by publicly acknowledging valuable contributors
4. **Increase Participation:** Drive more contributions through gamification and recognition

## User Stories

- **As a contributor**, I want to see recognition for my active participation so that I feel valued and motivated to continue contributing
- **As a repository visitor**, I want to see who the most engaged contributors are so that I can learn from their example
- **As a project maintainer**, I want to automatically highlight our most valuable contributors so that their efforts are recognized without manual effort
- **As a community member**, I want to share contributor achievements on social media so that I can help celebrate their accomplishments

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **The system must calculate contributor rankings based on weighted activities:**
   - Comments: 3x weight
   - Reviews: 3x weight  
   - PRs/Code contributions: 1x weight

2. **The system must display contributor rankings for the current repository only**

3. **The system must handle monthly cycles as follows:**
   - Calculate monthly winner based on previous month's activity (announced 1st of month)
   - Display winner prominently for the first week (1st-7th of month)
   - Reset to new month's running tally on the 8th
   - Show running leaderboard throughout the month

4. **The system must handle tie-breaking by selecting the contributor with the earliest contribution in the month**

### Display Requirements
5. **The system must display contributor information in a responsive card format including:**
   - Contributor avatar
   - Contributor name
   - Summary of their contributions (breakdown by activity type)

6. **The system must integrate with existing activity page design while maintaining mobile responsiveness**

7. **The system must show a running leaderboard of current month's top contributors**

8. **The system must display "Contributor of the Month" callout when no contributions exist for the current period**

### Social Sharing
9. **The system must provide social media sharing functionality for contributor achievements**

10. **The shared content must include contributor details and achievement summary**

### Edge Cases
11. **The system must display appropriate messaging when no contributions exist in a given month**

12. **The system must gracefully handle periods with minimal activity**

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Cross-repository contributor rankings
- Historical winner archives beyond current/previous month
- Manual override of contributor rankings
- Integration with external reward systems
- Detailed analytics dashboard for contribution patterns
- Contributor notification system for winning

## Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Card-based layout that adapts seamlessly between desktop and mobile viewports
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Winner should be more prominent during the first week, with running leaderboard clearly distinguished
- **Accessibility:** Ensure proper contrast ratios and screen reader compatibility
- **Social Sharing:** Include Open Graph meta tags and Twitter Card markup for rich social previews
- **Integration:** Align with existing activity page design patterns and color schemes

## Technical Considerations

- **Data Source:** Integrate with existing repository activity tracking systems
- **Caching:** Implement appropriate caching strategy for contributor calculations to minimize performance impact
- **Database:** May require new tables/fields to store monthly contributor statistics
- **API Integration:** Leverage existing repository APIs for activity data
- **Social Sharing:** Implement dynamic image generation for social media cards
- **Responsive Framework:** Ensure compatibility with existing CSS framework

## Success Metrics

- **Engagement Increase:** 15% increase in comments and reviews month-over-month
- **Contributor Retention:** 10% increase in returning contributors
- **Social Shares:** Track number of contributor achievement shares
- **Activity Growth:** Overall increase in repository activity and engagement
- **User Feedback:** Positive community response through surveys or feedback channels

## Open Questions

1. Should the feature include any gamification elements beyond recognition (badges, levels, etc.)?
2. Do we need any moderation controls for contributor eligibility?
3. Should there be different categories of recognition (e.g., "Most Helpful Reviewer", "Most Active Commenter")?
4. How should we handle contributors who prefer not to be highlighted publicly?
5. Should the social sharing feature generate dynamic images or use static templates?
