# Design System Phase 2: Component Enhancement

## Project Overview

### Objective
Enhance all existing Storybook stories (85+) with comprehensive documentation, missing variants, proper argTypes configuration, and interaction tests to create a complete component library.

### Background
Phase 1 successfully established the design tokens system and story patterns. Phase 2 will apply these patterns across all components, ensuring consistency and completeness.

### Success Metrics
- 100% of components have complete variant coverage
- All interactive components have play functions
- Every component has proper MDX documentation
- Composite component patterns established

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists
- 85+ stories across UI components, features, and utilities
- Design tokens system (colors, spacing, typography)
- Story template and patterns from Phase 1
- Basic stories with minimal documentation

### What Needs Improvement
- Many stories lack interaction tests
- Missing component variants and states
- No MDX documentation files
- No composite component examples
- Inconsistent argTypes configuration

### Phase 2C: Component Documentation (Day 3)
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Documentation Structure
For each component, create MDX documentation with:

2. **Usage** - When and how to use it
3. **Props** - Detailed prop documentation
4. **Examples** - Common use cases
5. **Accessibility** - ARIA requirements, keyboard navigation
6. **Best Practices** - Do's and don'ts
7. **Related Components** - Links to similar components

#### Documentation Files to Create
- [ ] `Button.mdx` - ✅ Can use existing as template

- [ ] `Layout.mdx` - Layout component patterns
- [ ] `DataDisplay.mdx` - Data visualization patterns
- [ ] `Navigation.mdx` - Navigation patterns
- [ ] `Feedback.mdx` - User feedback patterns

### Phase 2D: Composite Component Stories (Day 4)

  - Settings form with sections
  - Search with filters

- [ ] **Page Layouts**
  - Dashboard layout
  - Profile page
  - Repository view
  - Settings page

  - Data table with actions
  - File upload with preview
  - Multi-step wizard

- [ ] **Interactive Features**
  - Command palette
  - Notification system
  - Theme switcher
  - Language selector

## Technical Guidelines

### Story Structure Template
```typescript
export const ComponentVariant: Story = {
  args: {
    // All props with sensible defaults
  },
  argTypes: {
    // Control configurations for each prop
  },
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    // Interaction tests
  },
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        story: "Variant description",
      },
    },
  },
  tags: ["autodocs", "interaction", "accessibility"],
};
```

### Design Token Usage
- Always use design tokens from `.storybook/design-tokens.ts`
- Never hardcode colors, spacing, or typography values
- Use semantic token names where possible

### Testing Requirements
- All interactive components must have play functions
- Test keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Test error states and edge cases
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Per Component
- [ ] All variants documented (size, color, state)
- [ ] ArgTypes configured with proper controls
- [ ] Play functions for interactions
- [ ] Proper tags applied
- [ ] MDX documentation created
- [ ] Design tokens used consistently

### Overall
- [ ] 85+ stories enhanced and documented
- [ ] Composite patterns established
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Documentation complete and consistent
- [ ] No hardcoded design values

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with most-used components** (Button ✅, Input, Select, Card)
2. **Move to feature components** (Activity, Auth, Repository)
3. **Create documentation** as components are enhanced
4. **Build composite patterns** using enhanced components

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All stories render without errors
- [ ] Controls work properly in Storybook
- [ ] Interaction tests pass
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Visual appearance matches design system
- [ ] Documentation is clear and helpful

## Notes
