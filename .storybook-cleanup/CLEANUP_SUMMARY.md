# Storybook Cleanup Summary

## Date: Aug 22, 2024

### Files Removed
The following files were moved to `.storybook-cleanup/` for removal:

#### 1. Duplicate Component Stories
- `avatar.stories.tsx` - Replaced by `optimized-avatar.stories.tsx` which has GitHub-specific optimizations

#### 2. Default Storybook Example Files
- `Page.stories.ts` - Default example story
- `Page.tsx` - Default example component
- `Header.tsx` - Default example header component  
- `header.css` - Default example styles
- `page.css` - Default example styles

#### 3. Unused Assets
- `assets/` folder - Contains default Storybook images not referenced anywhere in the project:
  - accessibility.png/svg
  - addon-library.png
  - context.png
  - discord.svg
  - And other default Storybook assets

### Rationale
- Removed default Storybook example components that don't relate to contributor.info
- Eliminated duplicate avatar story in favor of the optimized version
- Cleaned up unused asset files that were taking up space
- Kept all project-specific stories and documentation

### Impact
- Reduced clutter in the stories folder
- Eliminated confusion between duplicate components
- Maintained all functional, project-specific stories

### Files Kept
- All enhanced UI component stories from Phase 2
- All composite pattern stories (FormPatterns, PageLayouts, etc.)
- All feature component stories (activity, auth, distribution, etc.)
- All MDX documentation files
- WelcomeEmail.stories.tsx (project-specific)

### Next Steps
After verifying Storybook still works correctly, the `.storybook-cleanup/` folder can be deleted permanently.
