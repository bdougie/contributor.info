# Hover Card Fixes Summary

All hover card issues have been successfully addressed! 🎉

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stale Cache Issue
**Problem:** Cache didn't invalidate when data changed (only tracked array length)  
**Solution:** Enhanced cache key to include most recent timestamps  
**File:** `src/lib/workspace-hover-card-utils.ts`

### 2. ✅ Incorrect PR Count
**Problem:** Hover card always showed "0 PRs" even when contributor had PRs  
**Solution:** Calculate actual count from workspace data  
**File:** `src/components/features/workspace/WorkspacePullRequestsTable.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Closed Issues in Open-Issue Chart
**Problem:** Hover card showed closed issues in a chart that only counts open ones  
**Solution:** Filter issues to match chart's open-issue filter  
**File:** `src/components/features/workspace/charts/AssigneeDistributionChart.tsx`

## Original Improvements (Already Completed)

From the previous implementation:

1. ✅ **Performance:** Pre-normalize usernames during data transformation
2. ✅ **Error Handling:** Add validation with graceful degradation
3. ✅ **Accessibility:** Add aria-labels for screen readers
4. ✅ **Memory:** Implement cache TTL (5min) and size limits (10 entries)

## Documentation

- 📄 [Hover Card Improvements](./docs/implementations/hover-card-improvements-summary.md)
- 📄 [Data Consistency Fixes](./docs/implementations/hover-card-data-consistency-fixes.md)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hover over contributors in PR table - verify accurate PR count
- [ ] Update a PR and refresh page - verify cache invalidates and shows new data
- [ ] Hover over assignees in distribution chart - verify only open issues shown
- [ ] Test with screen reader - verify aria-labels work
- [ ] Long session (5+ min) - verify memory doesn't leak
- [ ] Check browser console - verify no warnings about invalid data

## Next Steps

1. Run the test suite: `npm test`
2. Manual testing in dev environment
3. Review changes with team
4. Merge to main branch
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor for any issues

## Performance Impact

✅ **Positive:**
- Pre-normalized usernames reduce computation on hover
- Cache reduces repeated data transformations
- TTL prevents unbounded memory growth

⚠️ **Watch:**
- Cache hash computation on large datasets (>500 items)
- Monitor cache hit/miss rates in production
