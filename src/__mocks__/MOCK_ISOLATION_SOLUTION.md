# Mock Isolation Solution for Vitest Tests

## Problem Addressed
The project was experiencing mock isolation issues in vitest tests due to `isolate: false` being set for performance reasons. This caused:

1. Mocks bleeding between tests
2. Insufficient mock cleanup
3. Shared state contamination
4. React Router mocks causing conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Mock Setup (`simple-setup.ts`)

The improved setup file includes comprehensive mock isolation strategies:

#### 1. Module Cache Reset
- Added `vi.resetModules()` to clear module cache between tests
- Added `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` to reset global mocks
- Ensures fresh module imports in each test

#### 2. Comprehensive Global Mocks
- **Fetch**: Enhanced with `clone()` method and proper headers
- **IntersectionObserver**: Complete mock implementation
- **ResizeObserver**: Added for component tests
- **matchMedia**: Added for responsive component tests
- **Console**: Mocked while preserving functionality

#### 3. Enhanced Supabase Mock
- Comprehensive chainable query builder implementation
- All Supabase query methods return chainable objects
- Proper auth, storage, and database method mocks
- Consistent return format: `{ data: [], error: null }`

#### 4. Global React Router Mock
- Prevents individual test files from creating conflicting mocks
- Provides consistent router context across all tests
- Includes all common router hooks and components

#### 5. DOM and State Cleanup
- Complete DOM cleanup between tests
- localStorage/sessionStorage clearing
- History state reset
- Timer cleanup with fake timer detection

### Key Improvements

#### beforeEach Hook
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.resetAllMocks();     // Clear mock call history
  vi.clearAllMocks();     // Clear implementations  
  vi.resetModules();      // Clear module cache
  vi.unstubAllGlobals();  // Reset global stubs
  cleanup();              // React Testing Library cleanup
  // DOM, storage, and state cleanup
});
```

#### afterEach Hook
```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  cleanup();
  vi.clearAllTimers();
  // Complete state restoration
});
```

### Benefits

1. **True Test Isolation**: Each test starts with completely fresh state
2. **Performance Maintained**: Keeps `isolate: false` for speed
3. **Reduced Flaky Tests**: Eliminates cross-test contamination
4. **Consistent Mocks**: Global mocks prevent test-specific conflicts
5. **Better Error Messages**: Clear, consistent mock behavior

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Remove Duplicate Mocks**: Test files no longer need to mock Supabase or React Router
2. **Trust Global Setup**: The setup handles all common mocking needs
3. **Add Specific Mocks**: Only mock test-specific behavior in individual files
4. **Clean Test Structure**: Focus on test logic, not mock setup

### Files Modified

- `/src/__mocks__/simple-setup.ts` - Comprehensive mock isolation implementation

### Tests That Should Now Pass

With this improved setup, the following previously excluded tests should now work:
- React Router related tests
- Supabase integration tests  
- Component tests with global dependencies
- Tests that previously had mock bleeding issues

### Validation

The setup includes validation for:
- Mock isolation between tests
- DOM state cleanup
- Module cache reset
- Global mock consistency

This solution maintains the performance benefits of `isolate: false` while providing the isolation guarantees needed for reliable testing.
