// This file has been removed as the tests were outdated.
// The progressive loading tests have been rewritten in progressive-loading.test.tsx
// to match the current implementation of the useProgressiveRepoData hook.
//
// The old tests were testing features that no longer exist:
// - data-testid attributes that were never implemented
// - lottery factor calculations that were moved/removed
// - direct commits that are now part of enhancement data
//
// See progressive-loading.test.tsx for the updated tests that match the current implementation.
