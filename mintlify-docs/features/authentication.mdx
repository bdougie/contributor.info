The **Authentication & Protected Features** system provides secure access to enhanced analytics and personalized insights through GitHub OAuth integration. Authentication unlocks advanced features while maintaining privacy and security for both users and repository data.

## Overview

The authentication system offers progressive onboarding, allowing public repository analysis without login while providing enhanced capabilities for authenticated users. This approach balances accessibility with advanced functionality for users who want deeper insights and personalized experiences.
