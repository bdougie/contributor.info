description: Ensures documentation is scannable with frequent examples and visual breaks
---

Documentation must not have more than one paragraph without including a code example, image, or bullet points. Break up text with visual elements like code blocks, bullet lists, numbered lists, or images. Never place two consecutive paragraphs together without a visual break. Optimize for easy scanning by humans and LLMs by using clear structure and frequent examples.
