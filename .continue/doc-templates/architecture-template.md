# [System/Feature] Architecture

## Overview

High-level description of what this architecture document covers and why this system exists.

## System Context

### Problem Statement

What problem does this solve? What pain points did we have before?

### Goals

- Primary goal 1
- Primary goal 2
- Non-goal: What this explicitly does NOT do

### Constraints

- Technical constraints (e.g., "must work with existing auth system")
- Business constraints (e.g., "needs to scale to 1M+ users")
- Time constraints

## Architecture Diagram

```
[User] --> [Frontend Component]
           |
           v
     [Service Layer] --> [External API]
           |
           v
     [Database] --> [Cache]
```

## Components

### Component 1: [Name]

**Purpose**: What this component does

**Location**: `src/lib/services/component-name.ts`

**Responsibilities**:
- Responsibility 1
- Responsibility 2

**Dependencies**:
- Depends on Component X
- Uses Service Y

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Decision: Why we chose approach A over B
- Trade-off: What we gained and what we gave up

### Component 2: [Name]

**Purpose**: What this component does

**Location**: `src/hooks/use-component.ts`

**Responsibilities**:
- Responsibility 1
- Responsibility 2

**Dependencies**:
- Depends on Component X

## Data Flow

### Request Flow

1. User action triggers component
2. Component calls service layer
3. Service validates input
4. Service makes API call
5. Response is cached
6. Component updates UI

```typescript
// Example of typical data flow
user.click()
  -> component.handleClick()
  -> service.fetchData()
  -> api.request()
  -> cache.set()
  -> component.setState()
```

### Data Model

```typescript
interface PrimaryDataModel {
  id: string;
  field1: Type;
  field2: Type;
  // Key fields and their purpose
}
```

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: [Choice Made]

**Context**: What situation led to this decision

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Pros and cons
- Option B: Pros and cons
- Option C: Pros and cons

**Decision**: We chose Option A

**Rationale**:
- Reason 1: Why this was the best choice
- Reason 2: What this enables for us
- Trade-off: What we're giving up

**Consequences**:
- Positive: What we gain
- Negative: What constraints this imposes
- Future: What this means for future development

### Decision 2: [Another Choice]

*(Same structure as Decision 1)*

## Integration Points

### External Services

- **Service 1**: How we integrate with it, authentication method
- **Service 2**: Data we send/receive, error handling

### Internal Services

- **Service A**: How this system talks to Service A
- **Service B**: Shared data models

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

1. **Scenario**: Network failure
   - **Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff
   - **User Impact**: Loading spinner, then error message

2. **Scenario**: Invalid data
   - **Handling**: Validation at service layer
   - **User Impact**: Form validation errors

### Fallback Strategy

What happens when things fail? Graceful degradation approach.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- **Caching**: What we cache and for how long
- **Lazy Loading**: What loads on demand
- **Batch Operations**: Where we batch requests

### Bottlenecks

- Known bottleneck 1 and mitigation
- Known bottleneck 2 and future plan

## Security

### Authentication

How this system authenticates users/requests.

### Authorization

What permissions are required and how they're checked.

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data handling
- Encryption approach
- PII considerations

## Scalability

### Current Limits

- Can handle X requests per second
- Database can store Y records efficiently

### Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal: How to add more instances
- Vertical: Resource limits and upgrades
- Data: Partitioning/sharding approach if needed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

What should be unit tested and where tests live.

### Integration Tests

What integration points need testing.

### E2E Tests

Critical user flows that need E2E coverage.

## Deployment

### Infrastructure

- Where this runs (server, serverless, edge)
- Required resources (memory, CPU)

### Configuration

Key environment variables and their purpose:

```bash
VARIABLE_NAME=value  # What this controls
```

### Monitoring

- Metrics to track
- Alerts to set up
- Logging approach

## Future Considerations

### Known Limitations

1. **Limitation**: Description of current limit
   - **Impact**: How this affects users
   - **Plan**: How we plan to address it

### Planned Improvements

- Improvement 1: What and when
- Improvement 2: What and when

### Migration Path

If this replaces an old system, how do we migrate?
