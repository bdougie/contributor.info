## Next Steps

1. Update HTML/JSX to use `<picture>` elements with WebP and PNG fallback
2. Implement lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` attribute
3. Use responsive images with `srcset` for different screen sizes
4. Consider using a CDN for image delivery

## Example Implementation

```jsx
<picture>
  <source srcset="/image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="/image.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="/image.png" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
</picture>
```
