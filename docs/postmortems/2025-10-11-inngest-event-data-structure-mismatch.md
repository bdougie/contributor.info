# Postmortem: Inngest Event Data Structure Mismatch

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Fully Resolved (PR #1098)
**Severity**: High (100% failure rate for affected jobs)
**Duration**: Unknown start → October 11, 2025 (initial fix) → October 12, 2025 (comprehensive prevention - PR #1098)
**Affected Systems**: `capture/pr.comments`, `capture/repository.issues`, `capture/pr.reviews`, `capture/issue.comments`, `update-pr-activity` background jobs

---

## Summary

Two critical background job types (`capture/pr.comments` and `capture/repository.issues`) were failing with 100% error rate due to **two separate bugs**:

1. **Event Data Structure Mismatch**: The client-side event dispatcher was sending `repositoryId` (UUID) but the Supabase Edge Function expected `owner` and `repo` strings, causing GitHub API requests with `undefined` values.

2. **Database Schema Mismatch** (discovered during fix verification): The Edge Function was attempting to insert a `repository_full_name` field that doesn't exist in the `issues` table schema, causing all database upserts to fail silently even after the event data issue was fixed.

**Note**: This is a **recurring architectural pattern** that has caused production issues multiple times. Previous incidents involved similar schema mismatches between code expectations and database reality.

---

## Impact

### User Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Scope**: All repositories attempting to sync PR comments or issues via Inngest
- **Data Loss**: No data loss, but gaps in comment and issue synchronization
- **User Experience**: Background sync jobs silently failed; users unaware of missing data

### System Impact
- Failed jobs: 100% of `capture/pr.comments` and `capture/repository.issues` events
- GitHub API calls wasted on invalid requests
- Inngest retry attempts exhausted without resolution
- Database jobs marked as "failed" with unclear error messages

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened

The issue stemmed from **architectural drift** between two Inngest implementations:

1. **Client-side Inngest functions** (in `src/lib/inngest/functions/`):
   - Modern implementation using UUIDs
   - Event data: `{ repositoryId: string, prNumber: number, prId: string }`
   - Query database for `owner`/`repo` using `repositoryId`

2. **Supabase Edge Function** (in `supabase/functions/inngest-prod/index.ts`):
   - Legacy implementation expecting split fields
   - Event data: `{ owner: string, repo: string, pr_number: number, github_token: string }`
   - Directly use `owner`/`repo` in GitHub API calls

### Timeline of Events

1. **Original Design** (Early 2024):
   - Supabase Edge Functions created first
   - Used `owner`/`repo` pattern matching GitHub API structure
   - Included `repository_full_name` field in database inserts
   - Worked for direct GitHub webhook processing

2. **Client-Side Refactor** (Mid-2024):
   - Introduced `repositoryId` (UUID) as primary identifier
   - Hybrid queue manager built to use database-first approach
   - Client-side functions updated to query database for owner/repo
   - **MISSED**: Updating Supabase Edge Function to match

3. **Database Schema Evolution** (Date unknown):
   - `repository_full_name` column removed from `issues` table
   - Schema now uses foreign key `repository_id` to `repositories` table
   - No cleanup of code still referencing `repository_full_name`
   - **MISSED**: Updating Edge Function upsert queries

4. **First Failure Point** (Unknown date):
   - Events sent from hybrid queue manager with new structure
   - Supabase Edge Function received events with wrong structure
   - `const { owner, repo } = event.data` destructured to `undefined`
   - GitHub API calls failed: `/repos/undefined/undefined/issues`

5. **Second Failure Point** (October 11, 2025 - discovered during fix):
   - Fixed event data structure mismatch
   - Jobs completed successfully (HTTP 200)
   - Database still not being updated
   - Investigation revealed `repository_full_name` doesn't exist in schema
   - All upserts were failing with column not found error

### Why It Persisted

1. **Silent Failures**: Jobs failed without user-visible errors; database errors caught by try/catch but not thrown
2. **Monitoring Gap**: No alerts configured for Inngest job failures
3. **Dual Architecture**: Two parallel Inngest implementations (client + Supabase) with diverging code
4. **No Type Safety**: Event data structures not enforced at compile time
5. **Missing Tests**: No integration tests validating event flow end-to-end
6. **Schema Drift**: Database schema evolved but code referencing old columns was never updated
7. **No Database Constraint Validation**: Supabase client doesn't fail loudly on column mismatches
8. **Recurring Pattern**: Similar schema mismatch issues have happened before but weren't systematically prevented

## Technical Details

### Error Messages

**Issue #1: Event Data Structure Mismatch**
```
NonRetriableError: Resource not found: /repos/undefined/undefined/issues?state=all&per_page=100
    at githubRequest (file:///var/tmp/sb-compile-edge-runtime/inngest-prod/index.ts:53:11)
```

```
NonRetriableError: Resource not found: /repos/undefined/undefined/pulls/undefined/comments
    at githubRequest (file:///var/tmp/sb-compile-edge-runtime/inngest-prod/index.ts:53:11)
```

**Issue #2: Database Schema Mismatch** (discovered during fix verification)
```
ERROR: 42703: column "repository_full_name" of relation "issues" does not exist
LINE 7:   repository_full_name,
          ^
```

This error was caught by the Supabase client but not thrown, allowing jobs to complete with HTTP 200 status while silently failing to update the database.

### Code Comparison

**Before (Supabase Edge Function):**
```typescript
async ({ event, step }) => {
  const { owner, repo, pr_number, github_token } = event.data;

  const [reviewComments, issueComments] = await step.run('fetch-all-comments', async () => {
    const [revComments, issComments] = await Promise.all([
      githubRequest(`/repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments`, github_token),
      githubRequest(`/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${pr_number}/comments`, github_token),
    ]);
    return [revComments, issComments];
  });
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
async ({ event, step }) => {
  const { repositoryId, prNumber, prId } = event.data;

  // Step 1: Get repository details from database
  const repository = await step.run('get-repository', async () => {
    const supabase = getSupabaseClient();
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('repositories')
      .select('owner, name')
      .eq('id', repositoryId)
      .maybeSingle();

    if (error || !data) {
      throw new NonRetriableError(`Repository not found: ${repositoryId}`);
    }
    return data;
  });

  const owner = repository.owner;
  const repo = repository.name;
  const pr_number = prNumber;

  const [reviewComments, issueComments] = await step.run('fetch-all-comments', async () => {
    const [revComments, issComments] = await Promise.all([
      githubRequest(`/repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments`),
      githubRequest(`/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${pr_number}/comments`),
    ]);
    return [revComments, issComments];
  });
```

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix

**Fix #1: Event Data Structure** (Issue discovered first)

1. **Updated `capturePrComments`** (lines 489-526):
   - Accept `repositoryId`, `prNumber`, `prId` from event data
   - Added `get-repository` step to query database
   - Extract `owner` and `name` from database query
   - Removed `github_token` parameter (uses env var)

2. **Updated `captureRepositoryIssues`** (lines 619-656):
   - Accept `repositoryId`, `timeRange` from event data
   - Added `get-repository` step to query database
   - Extract `owner` and `name` from database query
   - Removed `github_token` parameter (uses env var)

**Fix #2: Database Schema Mismatch** (Issue discovered during verification)

3. **Removed `repository_full_name` from upserts** (line 689):
   - Deleted `repository_full_name: \`${owner}/${repo}\`` from issues upsert
   - Field doesn't exist in current `issues` table schema
   - Schema uses `repository_id` foreign key instead
   - This fix was critical - without it, all database updates failed silently

**Verification Test Created**:
- Created `test-repository-issues-with-verification.mjs` script
- Automatically checks if database is being updated after triggering event
- Polls database every 5 seconds for up to 60 seconds
- First test after Fix #1: Timed out (no updates)
- Second test after Fix #2: ✅ Success (7 issues synced in 5 seconds)

### Files Modified

- `supabase/functions/inngest-prod/index.ts` - Both event structure and schema fixes
- `scripts/testing-tools/test-repository-issues-with-verification.mjs` - New verification script

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy updated Supabase function (deployed twice - once after each fix)
supabase functions deploy inngest-prod --no-verify-jwt
```

### Verification Process

1. First deployment (Fix #1 only):
   - Jobs completed with HTTP 200
   - Inngest dashboard showed "Completed" status
   - Database: 0 updates (verification script timed out)

2. Investigation:
   - Manually tested upsert query in SQL editor
   - Discovered `repository_full_name` column doesn't exist
   - Checked `issues` table schema - confirmed missing column

3. Second deployment (Fix #2 applied):
   - Jobs completed with HTTP 200
   - Database: 7 issues updated in 5 seconds ✅

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Quick Diagnosis**: Root cause identified within 30 minutes of investigation
2. **Clear Error Messages**: GitHub API error clearly showed `undefined` values
3. **Documentation**: Existing PRD structure made solution planning straightforward
4. **Branch Strategy**: Debug branch isolated investigation and fixes

### What Went Wrong

1. **Architecture Drift**: Two implementations diverged without detection
2. **Silent Failures**: No alerts for background job failures
3. **Missing Tests**: Event flow not validated end-to-end
4. **No Type Safety**: Event structures not enforced
5. **Communication Gap**: Refactor didn't update all consumers

## Questions & Answers

**Q: How did this issue go undetected for so long?**
A: Background jobs fail silently without user-visible impact. We lacked monitoring for Inngest job failures and relied on manual observation rather than automated alerts.

**Q: Were there any data integrity issues?**
A: No data corruption occurred. The jobs failed early before writing to database. However, there were gaps in data synchronization that need backfilling.

**Q: Could this happen again with other events?**
A: Yes, without type safety and integration tests. The prevention measures address this by adding schema validation, monitoring, and E2E tests. **CRITICAL**: This is a recurring pattern - similar schema mismatches have happened before.

**Q: Why maintain two Inngest implementations?**
A: Historical reasons. Client-side handles real-time jobs, Supabase handles scheduled/bulk jobs. We're evaluating consolidation as part of prevention measures.

**Q: Why didn't the database errors throw and fail the job?**
A: The Supabase client's `.upsert()` method returns errors in the response object rather than throwing exceptions. The code checks `if (error)` and logs to console, but doesn't throw, so the job step completes "successfully" despite database failures.

**Q: Are there other places in the codebase with `repository_full_name` references?**
A: ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #1098)**: Comprehensive audit completed for `supabase/functions/inngest-prod/index.ts`. All instances fixed:
- `pr_comments` table: 2 locations fixed
- `pr_reviews` table: 2 locations fixed
- `issue_comments` table: 1 location fixed
- `update-pr-activity` queries: 3 locations fixed

Schema validation tests now prevent future occurrences.

## Additional Findings During Fix

During verification testing, a **second instance of the same pattern** was discovered:

**`pr_comments` table (line 546)**: Edge Function attempts to upsert `repository_full_name`, but the `pr_comments` table schema only has `repository_id`. This will cause the same silent failure pattern.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED in PR #1098** - All schema mismatches resolved:
- Fixed `pr_comments` table (2 locations)
- Fixed `pr_reviews` table (2 locations)
- Fixed `issue_comments` table (1 location)
- Fixed `update-pr-activity` function (3 query locations)

**Comprehensive Audit**: ✅ **COMPLETED in PR #1098** - ALL database upserts in `supabase/functions/inngest-prod/index.ts` have been audited and corrected. Schema validation tests now prevent future occurrences.
