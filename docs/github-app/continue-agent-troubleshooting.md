# CodeBunny Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
The @codebunny bot performs automated code reviews on pull requests when mentioned in comments. This guide helps diagnose and fix issues when the bot doesn't respond.

## Quick Checks

### 1. Verify GitHub App Configuration
- **App ID**: Check that `APP_ID` is set as a repository secret
- **Private Key**: Ensure `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` is set as a repository secret
- **Continue API Key**: Verify `CONTINUE_API_KEY` is set as a repository secret
- **Continue Org**: Set `CONTINUE_ORG` as a repository variable
- **Continue Config**: Set `CONTINUE_CONFIG` as a repository variable

```bash
# Check in repository settings:
# Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
```

### 2. Check Workflow Runs
1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Look for "CodeBunny Code Review" workflow runs
3. Check if the workflow was triggered when you mentioned @codebunny

### 3. Verify Bot Mention Format
The bot responds to mentions in this format:
```
@codebunny
@codebunny review this
@codebunny focus on security
```

**Important**: The mention must be in a comment on a pull request, not on a regular issue.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Workflow Doesn't Trigger

**Symptoms:**
- No workflow run appears when mentioning @codebunny
- Workflow shows as "skipped"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the comment is on a PR, not an issue
2. Check workflow permissions in repository settings
3. Ensure the workflow file exists in the default branch

### Issue: Bot Doesn't React with ðŸ‘€

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow runs but no reaction appears on the comment

**Solutions:**
1. Check GitHub App token generation in workflow logs
2. Verify the App has write permissions for pull requests
3. Check for rate limiting issues

### Issue: Continue CLI Not Found

**Error Message:**
```
Continue CLI not found. Make sure @continuedev/cli is installed.
```

**Solutions:**
1. The CodeBunny action should auto-install the CLI
2. Check the CodeBunny action includes the installation step
3. Verify npm/node setup in the workflow

### Issue: Continue CLI Times Out

**Error Message:**
```
Continue CLI execution timed out after 7 minutes
```

**Solutions:**
1. Large PRs may take longer to review
2. Consider breaking PR into smaller chunks
3. Check Continue API service status

### Issue: No Review Posted

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow completes but no review comment appears

**Solutions:**
1. Check workflow logs for posting errors
2. Verify GitHub token has write permissions
3. Look for rate limiting on the repository

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Enable Debug Logging
The workflow now includes detailed debug logging. Check the workflow run logs for:
- Event trigger information
- Token generation status
- Continue CLI execution details
- Error messages and stack traces

### 2. Check Workflow Logs
```bash
# In the workflow run, expand these steps:
1. "Debug Workflow Trigger" - Shows event details
2. "Verify Token Generation" - Confirms App token creation
3. "CodeBunny Review" - Main execution logs
```

### 3. Manual Testing
You can manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to Actions â†’ CodeBunny Code Review
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch with your PR
4. Check the logs for any errors

### 4. Verify Secrets and Variables
```bash
# Required repository secrets:
APP_ID                    # GitHub App ID from codebunny
APP_PRIVATE_KEY           # GitHub App private key
CONTINUE_API_KEY          # Continue service API key

# Required repository variables:
CONTINUE_ORG              # Continue organization name
CONTINUE_CONFIG           # Continue assistant config (org/assistant-name)
```

## Error Messages Reference

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Required input missing: github-token` | Token not generated | Check App credentials |
| `Continue CLI not found` | CLI installation failed | Check action.yml setup |
| `Invalid webhook signature` | Wrong webhook secret | Verify webhook configuration |
| `Not a pull request comment` | Comment on issue, not PR | Use on PR comments only |
| `Comment does not mention @codebunny` | Bot not mentioned | Include @codebunny in comment |

## Testing the Fix

After making changes:

1. **Test on a PR comment:**
   ```
   @codebunny please review this code
   ```

2. **Check for bot reaction:**
   - Should see ðŸ‘€ reaction within seconds
   - Review should appear within 1-3 minutes

3. **Monitor workflow:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Watch the workflow run in real-time
   - Check logs if issues occur
