# Postmortem Documentation

This directory contains detailed postmortem reports documenting incidents, their root causes, resolutions, and lessons learned from production issues in contributor.info.

## Purpose

Postmortems help developers:
- **Learn from failures** - Understand what went wrong and why
- **Prevent recurrence** - Document fixes and preventive measures  
- **Share knowledge** - Help team members troubleshoot similar issues
- **Track improvements** - Monitor system reliability over time

- **Date & Summary** - When it happened and what went wrong
- **Impact** - How it affected users and systems
- **Root Cause** - Technical details of what caused the issue
- **Resolution** - Steps taken to fix the problem
- **Prevention** - Measures to prevent similar issues
- **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways for the team

## Common Issue Categories

## Using This Documentation

### For Incident Response
1. Check similar past incidents in relevant category
2. Look for root cause patterns
3. Apply documented troubleshooting steps
4. Document new findings for future reference

### For Prevention
1. Review postmortems during feature development
2. Implement recommended monitoring and alerts
3. Add preventive measures to deployment checklists
4. Update testing strategies based on past failures

### For Learning
1. New team members should read recent postmortems
2. Use patterns to identify potential risks in new code
3. Understand system failure modes and recovery procedures

## Writing New Postmortems

When documenting new incidents:
1. **Be blameless** - Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
2. **Be specific** - Include exact error messages, timestamps, and technical details
3. **Be actionable** - Provide clear next steps and prevention measures
4. **Be timely** - Write while details are fresh in memory
