# Production Deployment Postmortem: White Screen and Module Loading Failures

**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Severity:** Critical (Complete production outage)  
**Status:** Resolved

## Incident Summary

The production deployment experienced a complete failure resulting in a white screen for all users. The root cause was a combination of server MIME type configuration issues and aggressive JavaScript module splitting that broke React initialization order.

## Timeline

- **Initial Deploy:** Production site showed white screen
- **First Error:** `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"`
- **Secondary Errors:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLayoutEffect')` and `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')`
- **Resolution:** Fixed MIME types and simplified module chunking strategy

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues

1. **Server MIME Type Misconfiguration**
   - Netlify was serving JavaScript files with `application/octet-stream` content type
   - Browsers enforce strict MIME type checking for ES modules
   - Caused complete failure to load any JavaScript modules

2. **React Module Initialization Race Condition**
   - Vite's manual chunking split React core from React-dependent libraries
   - Module preload order didn't guarantee execution order
   - React-dependent code executed before React was fully initialized

3. **Build Artifact Contamination**
   - TSX source files were included in production build
   - Caused by explicit `.tsx` extension in import statements
   - Created additional loading confusion

### Contributing Factors

- **Aggressive Tree Shaking:** `moduleSideEffects: false` was too aggressive for React ecosystem
- **Complex Chunking Strategy:** Function-based manual chunks created unpredictable loading order
- **Missing Server Configuration:** No explicit MIME type headers for Netlify

## Impact

- **User Impact:** 100% of production users saw white screen
- **Business Impact:** Complete site unavailability
- **Developer Impact:** Difficult to debug due to minified production code

## Resolution

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Added Explicit MIME Type Headers**
   ```toml
   # netlify.toml
   [[headers]]
     for = "/*.js"
     [headers.values]
       Content-Type = "text/javascript"
   ```

2. **Simplified Module Chunking**
   ```typescript
   // Bundle React with all dependencies to prevent race conditions
   manualChunks: {
     'react-vendor': ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom', '@radix-ui/react-slot'],
     'vendor': ['date-fns', 'zod', 'zustand'],
     'charts': ['@nivo/scatterplot', 'recharts']
   }
   ```

3. **Fixed Import Statements**
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   import App from './App.tsx';
   // To:
   import App from './App';
   ```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Local development caught no issues (dev server handles MIME types automatically)
- Build process worked correctly once configuration was fixed
- Modular architecture made it easy to identify chunk-related issues

### What Could Be Improved
- **Pre-deployment Testing:** Need staging environment that mirrors production server configuration
- **Build Validation:** Automated checks for production build artifacts
- **Module Loading Strategy:** Simpler, more predictable chunking approach

## Action Items

### Immediate (Completed)
- [x] Fix MIME type configuration
- [x] Simplify module chunking strategy  
- [x] Remove explicit file extensions from imports

### Short Term
- [ ] Set up staging environment with production-like server configuration
- [ ] Add build validation scripts to CI/CD
- [ ] Document deployment checklist

### Long Term
- [ ] Implement automated production smoke tests
- [ ] Consider adopting framework with better production defaults
- [ ] Review and document module loading best practices

## Prevention Measures

1. **Staging Environment:** Deploy-preview environment should match production server configuration
2. **Build Validation:** Automated checks for common production issues (MIME types, module loading)
3. **Deployment Checklist:** Mandatory pre-deployment verification steps
4. **Monitoring:** Real-time alerts for production JavaScript errors

## Technical Debt Created

- Larger initial bundle size due to bundling React with dependencies
- Less optimal caching strategy (trade-off for reliability)
- Need to revisit module splitting strategy in future
