# New repository setup

## What happens when you search for a repository

### First visit
1. **Search for any repository** - Type `owner/repo` in the search box
2. **Instant results** - See cached data immediately if we've analyzed it before
3. **Automatic setup** - New repositories start analyzing in the background

### Setup process

**For new repositories:**
- Setup notification appears: "Setting up pytorch/pytorch..."
- Background analysis begins immediately
- You can navigate away and return later
- Process typically completes in 1-2 minutes

**What we analyze:**
- Pull requests from the last 30 days
- Code reviews and comments
- Contributor activity patterns
- Repository metadata and statistics

## Notifications

### Setup started
> Setting up pytorch/pytorch...
> 
> This is a new repository! We're gathering contributor data for you. This usually takes 1-2 minutes.

### Setup complete
> Repository data updated!
> 
> Fresh data is now available

### If something goes wrong
