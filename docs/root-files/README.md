# Root Files Archive

This directory contains documentation files that were previously in the project root and have been archived for reference.

## Contents

### Project Documentation
- **[agents.md](./agents.md)** - Agent configuration and setup documentation

## Purpose

This directory serves as an archive for documentation that was located in the project root directory. Files here have been moved to maintain a clean project structure while preserving historical documentation.
