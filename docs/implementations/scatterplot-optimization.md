# Scatterplot Optimization - Implementation Documentation

**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**PR**: [#637 - Fix mobile ScatterPlot overlapping issue](https://github.com/bdougie/contributor.info/pull/637)  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Overview

Optimized the contribution scatterplot visualization to improve performance and clarity, especially on mobile devices. The scatterplot now shows a focused distribution of contributions with unique contributor prioritization.

## Key Changes

### Display Logic
- **Desktop**: Shows up to 50 unique contributor avatars
- **Mobile**: Shows up to 25 unique contributor avatars  
- **Duplicate Handling**: Duplicate contributions from the same contributor are rendered as smaller gray squares
- **Z-index Layering**: Avatars always render on top of gray squares for better visibility

### Visual Improvements
- Gray squares are 60% the size of avatars and have 0.6 opacity
- Improved theme-aware borders (white in dark mode, black in light mode)
- Safari compatibility with fallback to native SVG elements

### Performance Optimizations
- Limited data processing for mobile devices
- Unique contributor tracking using Set data structure
- Efficient z-index sorting for render order

## Technical Implementation

**Modified Files:**
- `src/components/features/activity/contributions.tsx` - Main scatterplot component

**Key Features:**
1. **Unique Contributor Tracking**: Uses a Set to track which contributors have been shown
2. **Safari Detection**: Fallback rendering for Safari compatibility issues
3. **Responsive Limits**: Different avatar limits for mobile (25) vs desktop (50)
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Gray squares for duplicates, full avatars for unique contributors
5. **Click Interactions**: All avatars link to their respective pull requests

## Description Update
Changed from: "Visualize the size and frequency of contributions"  
Changed to: "Visualize the distribution of contributions"

This better reflects the chart's purpose of showing contribution patterns rather than raw frequency counts.
