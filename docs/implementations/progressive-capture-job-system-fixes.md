# Progressive Capture Job System Fixes

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive fixes applied to the progressive capture job system to resolve critical issues with job processing, error handling, and system reliability. These fixes addressed problems where jobs were getting stuck, failing silently, or not properly updating their status in the database.

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. Job Status Update Race Conditions

**Problem**: Jobs were updating their status multiple times in quick succession, causing race conditions where the final status might not reflect the actual job state.

**Solution**: Implemented atomic status updates with proper transaction handling and added status transition validation to ensure jobs follow the correct lifecycle.

```typescript
// Before: Multiple uncoordinated updates
await updateJobStatus(jobId, 'processing');
// ... some work ...
await updateJobStatus(jobId, 'completed');

// After: Atomic transaction with validation
await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  const currentStatus = await tx.select().from(jobs).where(eq(jobs.id, jobId));
  if (isValidTransition(currentStatus, newStatus)) {
    await tx.update(jobs).set({ 
      status: newStatus,
      updated_at: new Date()
    }).where(eq(jobs.id, jobId));
  }
});
```

### 2. Missing Error Handling in Job Processors

**Problem**: Job processors were failing silently without proper error capture, making debugging difficult and leaving jobs in "processing" state indefinitely.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with Sentry integration and proper job failure recording.

```typescript
// Enhanced error handling pattern
try {
  await processJob(job);
  await markJobComplete(job.id);
} catch (error) {
  // Capture detailed error context
  Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
    scope.setTag('job.type', job.type);
    scope.setTag('job.id', job.id);
    scope.setContext('job_failure', {
      repository: job.repository_name,
      processor: job.processor_type,
      attempt: job.retry_count + 1
    });
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  });
  
  // Update job with error details
  await markJobFailed(job.id, error.message);
}
```

### 3. Progress Tracking Reliability

**Problem**: Progress updates were inconsistent, with some jobs showing 0% progress even when partially complete, and others losing progress data on retries.

**Solution**: Implemented robust progress tracking with checkpoint saving and proper progress restoration on retry.

```typescript
// Progress checkpoint system
interface ProgressCheckpoint {
  job_id: string;
  total_items: number;
  processed_items: number;
  failed_items: number;
  last_processed_id?: string;
  checkpoint_data?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Save progress at regular intervals
async function updateProgressWithCheckpoint(
  jobId: string, 
  progress: ProgressUpdate
) {
  await db.update(progressTable).set({
    ...progress,
    checkpoint_data: JSON.stringify({
      last_pr_number: progress.current_item,
      processed_ids: progress.processed_ids
    }),
    updated_at: new Date()
  }).where(eq(progressTable.job_id, jobId));
}
```

### 4. Retry Logic Improvements

**Problem**: Failed jobs were being retried immediately without backoff, causing cascading failures and overwhelming the system.

**Solution**: Implemented exponential backoff with jitter and smarter retry decision logic based on error types.

```typescript
// Smart retry configuration
const getRetryDelay = (retryCount: number): number => {
  const baseDelay = 60000; // 1 minute
  const maxDelay = 3600000; // 1 hour
  
  // Exponential backoff with jitter
  const exponentialDelay = Math.min(
    baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount),
    maxDelay
  );
  
  // Add 0-30% jitter to prevent thundering herd
  const jitter = exponentialDelay * Math.random() * 0.3;
  
  return Math.floor(exponentialDelay + jitter);
};

// Error-based retry decisions
const shouldRetry = (error: Error, retryCount: number): boolean => {
  // Don't retry permanent errors
  if (isPermanentError(error)) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Retry transient errors up to limit
  return retryCount < MAX_RETRIES;
};
```

### 5. Database Connection Pool Management

**Problem**: Long-running jobs were exhausting database connections, causing subsequent jobs to fail with connection timeouts.

**Solution**: Implemented proper connection pool management with connection recycling and monitoring.

```typescript
// Connection pool configuration
const poolConfig = {
  max: 20,
  min: 2,
  acquireTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
  
  // Connection validation
  validate: (connection) => {
    return connection.query('SELECT 1').then(() => true).catch(() => false);
  }
};

// Connection usage monitoring
const trackConnectionUsage = () => {
  const pool = db.getPool();
  
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: 'database',
    message: 'Connection pool stats',
    level: 'info',
    data: {
      total: pool.totalCount,
      idle: pool.idleCount,
      waiting: pool.waitingCount
    }
  });
};
```

### 6. Job Queue Priority System

**Problem**: All jobs were processed in FIFO order, causing important manual triggers to wait behind large scheduled jobs.

**Solution**: Implemented a priority-based queue system with intelligent job routing.

```typescript
// Priority calculation
const calculateJobPriority = (job: QueuedJob): number => {
  let priority = 0;
  
  // Manual triggers get highest priority
  if (job.trigger_source === 'manual') {
    priority += 40;
  }
  
  // Small repositories process faster
  if (job.repository_size === 'small') {
    priority += 30;
  } else if (job.repository_size === 'medium') {
    priority += 20;
  }
  
  // Recent data is more important
  if (job.time_range_days <= 7) {
    priority += 20;
  }
  
  // Retries get slight priority boost
  priority += Math.min(job.retry_count * 5, 15);
  
  return priority;
};
```

### 7. Monitoring and Alerting

**Problem**: No visibility into job system health, making it difficult to detect and respond to issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive monitoring with Sentry integration and health check endpoints.

```typescript
// Health check implementation
export async function getQueueHealth(): Promise<QueueHealthMetrics> {
  const metrics = await db.select({
    status: jobs.status,
    processor: jobs.processor_type,
    count: count()
  })
  .from(jobs)
  .groupBy(jobs.status, jobs.processor_type);
  
  const health = calculateHealthScore(metrics);
  
  // Alert on unhealthy conditions
  if (health.score < 70) {
    Sentry.captureMessage('Queue health degraded', {
      level: 'warning',
      extra: { metrics, health }
    });
  }
  
  return health;
}
```

## Implementation Timeline

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. Idempotent Job Processing
All job processors are now idempotent, allowing safe retries without data duplication.

### 2. Graceful Shutdown Handling
Jobs properly checkpoint their progress and can resume from where they left off.

### 3. Resource Limits
Memory and time limits prevent runaway jobs from affecting system stability.

### 4. Dead Letter Queue
Permanently failed jobs are moved to a dead letter queue for manual inspection.

## Monitoring Dashboard Enhancements

The capture monitor (`/dev/capture-monitor`) now displays:
- Real-time job processing rates
- Error rate trends
- Queue depth by priority
- Average processing times by job type
- Connection pool utilization
- Recent failure reasons

## Future Improvements

1. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamically adjust processor capacity based on queue depth
2. **Job Dependencies**: Support for job chains and dependencies
3. **Batch Operations**: Group similar jobs for more efficient processing
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Cron-like scheduling for recurring jobs
5. **Job Templates**: Reusable job configurations for common scenarios

## Debugging Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Jobs Stuck in Processing**
   ```sql
   -- Find stuck jobs (processing > 1 hour)
   SELECT * FROM progressive_capture_jobs 
   WHERE status = 'processing' 
   AND started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

2. **High Failure Rate**
   ```sql
   -- Analyze failure patterns
   SELECT error, COUNT(*) as count 
   FROM progressive_capture_jobs 
   WHERE status = 'failed' 
   AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   GROUP BY error 
   ORDER BY count DESC;
   ```

3. **Queue Backup**
   ```sql
   -- Check queue depth by priority
   SELECT 
     processor_type,
     CASE 
       WHEN metadata->>'priority' IS NULL THEN 0
       ELSE (metadata->>'priority')::int
     END as priority,
     COUNT(*) as count
   FROM progressive_capture_jobs
   WHERE status = 'pending'
   GROUP BY processor_type, priority
   ORDER BY priority DESC;
   ```
