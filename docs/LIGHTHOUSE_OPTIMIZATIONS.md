# Lighthouse Performance Optimizations

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Issues Addressed

### Before Optimization:
- Main bundle: ~105 KiB (blocking LCP)
- UI Radix: ~32 KiB (blocking)
- Data: ~28 KiB (blocking)
- All analytics loaded synchronously

### After Optimization:

## âœ… Chunk Splitting Improvements

### Critical Path (Preloaded):
- `react-core`: 176 KiB (gzipped: 53.5 KiB) - Essential React runtime
- `react-router`: 24.9 KiB (gzipped: 8.8 KiB) - Routing essentials

### Deferred Loading:
- `ui-base`: 102 KiB â†’ Lazy loaded when needed
- `ui-overlay`: 9.7 KiB â†’ Loaded on demand (dialogs, dropdowns)
- `ui-interactive`: 22.2 KiB â†’ Loaded on demand (selects, popovers)
- `data`: 110 KiB â†’ Lazy loaded
- `analytics`: 269 KiB â†’ Completely deferred
- `charts`: 484 KiB â†’ Lazy loaded on chart pages
- `vendor`: 731 KiB â†’ Split and optimized

## ðŸš€ Performance Improvements

### 1. **Reduced Initial Bundle Size**
- Removed test dependencies from production build
- Split large UI library into smaller, lazy-loaded chunks
- Deferred analytics until after page interaction

### 2. **Improved Loading Strategy**
- Only preload critical React core and routing
- Lazy load providers (PostHog, MetaTags) with Suspense
- Defer web vitals tracking by 1 second
- Use `requestIdleCallback` for Sentry initialization

### 3. **Better Resource Prioritization**
- Critical path: React + Router (~62 KiB gzipped)
- Everything else lazy loaded or deferred
- Analytics completely non-blocking

## ðŸ“Š Expected Lighthouse Improvements

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):
- **Before**: Blocked by 165+ KiB of JS
- **After**: Only ~62 KiB blocking critical path
- **Expected improvement**: 20-30 point gain

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):
- Better with CSS code splitting enabled
- Suspense boundaries prevent layout jumps

### FID (First Input Delay):
- Less JS parsing on initial load
- Analytics deferred until after interaction

## ðŸ”§ Build Commands

```bash
# Lighthouse-optimized build
npm run build:lighthouse

# Includes bundle analysis
npm run build:lighthouse && node scripts/check-build-clean.js
```

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

- âœ… No test dependencies in production bundle
- âœ… Critical path under 100 KiB
- âœ… Analytics completely deferred
- âœ… UI components lazy loaded
- âœ… Charts only loaded when needed
- âœ… Proper chunk splitting strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Further Optimization

If more performance is needed:

1. **Service Worker**: Add resource caching
2. **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF conversion
3. **Font Loading**: Preload critical fonts
4. **Critical CSS**: Inline above-fold styles
5. **Resource Hints**: Add prefetch for likely routes
