# Lighthouse Performance Optimizations

## üéØ Key Issues Addressed

### Before Optimization:
- Main bundle: ~105 KiB (blocking LCP)
- UI Radix: ~32 KiB (blocking)
- Data: ~28 KiB (blocking)
- All analytics loaded synchronously

### After Optimization:

## ‚úÖ Chunk Splitting Improvements

### Critical Path (Preloaded):
- `react-core`: 142 KiB (gzipped: 45.7 KiB) - Essential React runtime
- `react-ecosystem`: 43 KiB (gzipped: 15.1 KiB) - Routing and utilities
- `charts-essential`: 316 KiB (gzipped: 105.0 KiB) - **Main PR contribution chart (@nivo/scatterplot)**

### Deferred Loading:
- `ui-radix`: 114 KiB (gzipped: 35.6 KiB) ‚Üí Loaded when UI components needed
- `data`: 109 KiB (gzipped: 30.1 KiB) ‚Üí Supabase and state management
- `analytics`: 412 KiB (gzipped: 137.5 KiB) ‚Üí Completely deferred (PostHog Provider, Sentry)
- `charts-advanced`: 314 KiB (gzipped: 78.4 KiB) ‚Üí Recharts for distribution analysis
- `icons`: 31 KiB (gzipped: 6.4 KiB) ‚Üí Lucide icons lazy loaded

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### 1. **Reduced Initial Bundle Size**
- Removed test dependencies from production build
- Split large UI library into smaller, lazy-loaded chunks
- Deferred analytics until after page interaction

### 2. **Improved Loading Strategy**
- Preload critical React core, routing, and essential charts
- Analytics providers (PostHog Provider, Sentry) deferred until after page load
- Advanced charts (Recharts) lazy loaded for distribution analysis
- Web vitals tracking deferred by 100ms to not block initial render
- Use `requestIdleCallback` for Sentry initialization

### 3. **Better Resource Prioritization**
- Critical path: React + Ecosystem + Essential Charts (~165.8 KiB gzipped)
- **Key change**: Main PR contribution chart preloaded to eliminate 3-second loading delay
- Heavy analytics (137.5 KiB) completely deferred (PostHog Provider, Sentry)
- Advanced charts (78.4 KiB) only loaded for distribution analysis
- UI components (35.6 KiB) loaded on demand

## üìä Expected Lighthouse Improvements

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):
- **Before**: Blocked by 165+ KiB of JS + 3-second chart loading delay
- **After**: ~165.8 KiB blocking critical path, but eliminates loading delay
- **Trade-off**: Larger critical path but immediate main feature availability
- **User experience**: No more waiting for PR contributions (main app feature)

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):
- Better with CSS code splitting enabled
- Suspense boundaries prevent layout jumps

### FID (First Input Delay):
- Less JS parsing on initial load
- Analytics deferred until after interaction

## üîß Build Commands

```bash
# Lighthouse-optimized build
npm run build:lighthouse

# Includes bundle analysis
npm run build:lighthouse && node scripts/check-build-clean.js
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

- ‚úÖ No test dependencies in production bundle
- ‚úÖ Critical path optimized for main app feature (~165.8 KiB gzipped)
- ‚úÖ Main PR contribution chart preloaded (eliminates 3-second wait)
- ‚úÖ Analytics completely deferred
- ‚úÖ UI components lazy loaded
- ‚úÖ Advanced charts (Recharts) only loaded for distribution analysis
- ‚úÖ Proper chunk splitting strategy with user experience priority

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bundle Splitting Configuration

### Current vite.config.ts Strategy

The bundle splitting prioritizes the main app feature (PR contributions) while keeping advanced features deferred:

```typescript
manualChunks: {
  // Core React - Essential runtime (Critical Path)
  'react-core': ['react', 'react-dom'],
  
  // Router and utilities (Critical Path)
  'react-ecosystem': [
    'react-router-dom',
    'class-variance-authority', 
    'clsx',
    'tailwind-merge'
  ],
  
  // Essential charts for PR contributions (Critical Path)
  'charts-essential': [
    '@nivo/scatterplot'  // Main PR contribution chart
  ],
  
  // Advanced visualization libraries (Deferred)
  'charts-advanced': [
    'recharts'  // Distribution analysis charts
  ],
  
  // UI library - deferred loading when UI components needed
  'ui-radix': [...],
  
  // Analytics - completely deferred
  'analytics': ['posthog-js', '@sentry/react']
}
```

### Preloading Configuration

```typescript
modulePreload: {
  polyfill: true,
  resolveDependencies: (_, deps) => {
    // Preload critical path + essential charts for PR contributions
    return deps.filter(dep => 
      dep.includes('react-core') || 
      dep.includes('react-ecosystem') ||
      dep.includes('charts-essential') || // Main PR chart
      // Exclude everything else for deferred loading
      (!dep.includes('analytics') && 
       !dep.includes('charts-advanced') && 
       !dep.includes('ui-radix') &&
       !dep.includes('icons') &&
       !dep.includes('data') &&
       !dep.includes('utils'))
    );
  }
}
```

### Why This Strategy Works

1. **User Experience Priority**: PR contributions are the main app feature
2. **Immediate Value**: Users see charts instantly instead of waiting 3 seconds
3. **Smart Deferral**: Advanced visualizations only load when needed
4. **Performance Balance**: Critical path larger but eliminates perceived loading time

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do Not Modify Without Testing

This configuration is specifically tuned to:
- Eliminate the 3-second loading delay for main PR charts
- Keep advanced features (distribution analysis) deferred
- Maintain reasonable Lighthouse scores while prioritizing UX

Before changing bundle splitting:
1. Test with `npm run build` to verify bundle sizes
2. Ensure `charts-essential` includes only `@nivo/scatterplot`
3. Keep `charts-advanced` separate for distribution analysis
4. Verify critical path stays under 200 KiB gzipped

## üéØ Next Steps for Further Optimization

If more performance is needed:

1. **Service Worker**: Add resource caching
2. **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF conversion
3. **Font Loading**: Preload critical fonts
4. **Critical CSS**: Inline above-fold styles
5. **Resource Hints**: Add prefetch for likely routes
