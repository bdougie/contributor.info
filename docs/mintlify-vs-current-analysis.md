3. Move remaining images to Supabase CDN

### Long Term (Consider)
**Migrate to Mintlify if**:
- Documentation grows significantly
- Need advanced features (search, AI, analytics)
- Want zero bundle impact
- Team collaboration on docs is important

**Stay with current setup if**:
- Want full control over docs
- Budget conscious (free vs $250+/month)
- Docs are minimal and not growing
- Don't need advanced features

## Migration Path to Mintlify
1. Export current Markdown files
2. Set up Mintlify account
3. Configure mintlify.json
4. Push docs to separate repo or branch
5. Configure custom domain
6. Remove docs from main bundle

## Expected Bundle Size Savings
- **Current**: 7MB+ total bundle
- **After image cleanup**: ~5.5MB
- **With Mintlify**: ~5MB (docs completely removed)
- **Savings**: 2MB+ immediate, future-proof growth
