### Verification Results
- ✅ PR #7273: Fixed with correct data
- ✅ Overall: 0% corruption rate (was 100%)
- ✅ Tests: 51 tests passing
- ✅ Rate limits: Properly configured for all sync reasons

### Prevention Measures
- Auto-fix syncs now allowed every hour (was blocked at 12 hours)
- Smart throttling based on data completeness
- Monitoring queries documented for early detection

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** - Check for any new corruption over next 24 hours
2. **Deploy** - Ensure changes are deployed to production
3. **Alert** - Set up monitoring for corruption detection
