## PRD Guidelines

Product Requirements Documents in this directory follow these standards:

### Structure
1. **Project Overview** - Objective, background, success metrics
2. **Current State Analysis** - What exists, what's broken, what needs improvement
3. **Implementation Plan** - Phased approach with clear priorities
4. **Technical Guidelines** - Architecture decisions, patterns to follow
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, measurable outcomes

### Process
- Break large features into 2-4 phases based on priority and dependencies
- Each phase should be completable in 1-3 days
- Mark phases as completed with âœ… as work progresses
- Update PRDs with implementation summaries after completion
