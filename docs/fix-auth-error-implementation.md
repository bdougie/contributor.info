# GitHub Auth Database Error Fix - Implementation Notes

**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Issue:** "Database error saving new user" on first-time login  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

## Summary

Fixed the "Database error saving new user" issue that occurred when new users tried to log in via GitHub OAuth. The error was caused by missing `app_users` records that should have been automatically created during the authentication flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Triggers (Primary Fix)
Created two migrations to handle automatic user creation:

#### Migration 1: `20250712000001_add_auth_user_trigger.sql`
- Basic trigger to create `app_users` and `contributors` records when a new auth user is created
- Handles both new signups and login events

#### Migration 2: `20250712000002_fix_auth_trigger_with_error_handling.sql`
- Improved version with proper error handling
- Uses declared variables (matching the post-mortem implementation)
- Calls the existing `upsert_app_user` function
- Includes a function to create missing records for existing users
- Adds EXCEPTION handling to prevent auth failures if trigger fails

### 2. Frontend Fallback (Safety Net)
Added fallback logic to both authentication hooks:

#### `src/hooks/use-admin-auth.ts` (lines 91-128)
- Detects when `is_user_admin` RPC fails due to missing user record
- Automatically calls `upsert_app_user` to create the record
- Retries the admin check after creating the user

#### `src/components/features/auth/auth-button.tsx` (lines 46-77)
- Same fallback logic for the auth button component
- Ensures user creation works from multiple entry points

## How It Works

1. **New User Signs Up:**
   - Supabase creates auth.users record
   - Trigger `on_auth_user_created` fires automatically
   - Calls `handle_new_auth_user()` function
   - Creates records in both `app_users` and `contributors` tables

2. **If Trigger Fails:**
   - Frontend detects the error (PGRST116 or "does not exist")
   - Automatically calls `upsert_app_user` RPC
   - Creates the missing records
   - Retries the original operation

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Database trigger has EXCEPTION block to prevent auth failures
   - Frontend has try-catch blocks for graceful degradation
   - Errors are logged but don't block user login

## Testing

1. Build passes with no TypeScript errors
2. All 500 tests passing
3. Database trigger exists and is active
4. Missing user records were created for existing auth users

## Next Steps

The immediate issue is fixed, but for long-term stability:
1. Monitor new user signups for any errors
2. Add E2E tests for the complete OAuth flow
3. Consider adding metrics to track trigger success rate
